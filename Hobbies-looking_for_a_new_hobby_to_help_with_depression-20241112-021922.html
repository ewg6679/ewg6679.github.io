A few years later I started trying to learn crochet, and just couldn’t wrap my brain around it. I had people try to teach me, tried the books again, finally after 3 attempts over a few years something finally clicked while using YouTube and it was like I was always crocheting.

They're great for different reasons. Crochet is basically making lots of knots, so not always the best choice for garments, but great for small wearable items and blankets. Knitting is basically weaving with two sticks and you can make all kinds of garments and get into the myriad of methods out there to do the same thing (English, Norwegian, Continental, Eastern European, I could go on without hitting all of the cast on and cast off methods). It tends to make a greater range of garments, if that's where you eventually want to go and seems to have a lot more designers, and the drape can be more fluid. It also uses about 1/3 less yarn than something comparable in crochet  (knots vs. weaving).</p></div></div><div class="o l5" id="t1_lvkk4qg"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/nvrsleepagin">nvrsleepagin</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lvkk4qg/">Tue 2024-11-05 at 12:13</a> (1) <a href="#t1_lus134o" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lutj2bu" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#" class="n B D">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lvkk4qg" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lvkk4qg)">◯</a></header><p>Cross stitch is great for a beginner also.</p><div class="e l6" id="t1_lvl9n4h"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Decent-Dot6753">Decent-Dot6753</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lvl9n4h/">Tue 2024-11-05 at 14:17</a> (1) <a href="#t1_lvkk4qg" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#" class="n A D">🠉</a> <a href="#" class="n B D">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lvl9n4h" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lvl9n4h)">◯</a></header><p>It is!

Anchor your elbow against the inside of your hip so that you can apply pressure just by leaning your torso in towards the clay. Your arm muscles don't have to do much work at all if you're properly anchored; it's just the weight of your torso directed via your forearm and wrist straight into the clay. This way, the clay cannot bully you around.</p></p><p><p>Don't worry about <a href="https://youtu.be/Z7HEolaHaxM?si=1zuJuiZ-Fzc1Atq9">coning up really tall and skinny</a>. You can just cone up and down from a hilltop shape to a plateau shape a couple times. Always keep the top of the plateau somewhat convex till you're ready to open it. Avoid the dreaded "volcano."</p></p><p><p>If you're using a bat and it's rattling against the bolts of the wheel head, you're bound to have a tough time. Make sure your surface is solid.</p></p><p><p>Learn to work in time with the rhythm of the wheel. Your motions should be in sync with the wheel's rotation - move up and down with each turn, or half turn, or two turns of the wheel. You can't really be overly deliberate about this and overthinking it will probably be counterproductive, but when you "get it," it will make sense. The main thing is to be smooth and consistent with your motions, not herky-jerky or hesitant.</p></p><p><p>Obviously, make sure your clay is well wedged first and the right consistency - not too soft/wet, not too firm/dry.</p></p><p><p>Spend a while watching YouTube demos. I learned a ton from Simon Leach's early videos like 15 years ago. Today, there's a whole lot more out there. I think Florian Gadsby makes gorgeous videos and explains himself well. Watch a variety. You'll pick up different tips that resonate with you from different potters.</p></p><p><p>And most importantly: Keep practicing! Centering is something that almost every beginning potter struggles with, and it takes time to conquer it. But once it "clicks" it will stick with you, and learning it will teach you so much about working with clay that will translate to other aspects of pottery.</p><div class="e l4" id="t1_lv4pyw5"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Goat_patrol">Goat_patrol</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lv4pyw5/">Sat 2024-11-02 at 22:13</a> (1) <a href="#t1_lv41f5i" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#" class="n A D">🠉</a> <a href="#" class="n B D">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lv4pyw5" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lv4pyw5)">◯</a></header><p>Thank you so much!!!

I enjoy it thoroughly and find it very cathartic.  It keeps you occupied (even a small piece can take 10+ hours) as you create something that you can see tangibly for your effort.  It extends my self-worth and is an artistic outlet.  I, so far, have given everything I've made away as gifts, and all recipients genuinely enjoy getting them.  They will think of you each time they look at it and will remember how you took the time to make something just for them (I always target the piece to be something very personal to them).

I’m trolling FB Marketplace and saw an ad for stained glass tools and glass pieces. Was selling for cheap, so I went to look at it. I get there and it is all sitting in my dad’s old toolbox. I start getting all choked up and the lady asks what’s wrong. I tell her that it’s my dad’s stuff and showed her my license (and I also have my dad’s old CCW card in my wallet) and she just gave it to me. She got it at an estate auction but never used it. So it took 7.5 years, but I got it all home. I need to make a fume hood so I can start making some art at home. I literally have everything he used, including the old 70’s card table, that he made lamps, windows, terrariums…heck, his biggest piece was two huge windows installed on some church doors. He just charged for the parts, and about a 10th of the labor rate and still got enough to get a second car for the house. In the mid 70’s it was about $12k.

You cannot be depressed while you have a human being in front of you who is trying to choke you or get you in an arm lock. All of your attention has to be in the moment. Being in physical contact with another person and having to work together to learn a move in class and trust each other through that process is a natural antidepressant for me. I'm much more motivated to go to class than to do any of my other hobbies because there are other people there who are relying on me to be a training partner. You also gain a lot of confidence learning how to defend yourself. I know you're concerned about injury, but if you just learn the drills in class, take it slow, and don't do live rolling/open mat where it's a free for all, your injury chances are pretty limited as long as you and your training partners are considerate. Tap out earlier than you need to to play it safe. It will definitely be confusing and intimidating when you start but stick with it and learn how to be comfortable being uncomfortable. It gets better the longer you go. It's like learning a new language by immersion when you start and it won't make sense at first. After 2 years, it's one of the best decisions I've ever made for myself. Even when I'm having an incredibly low week of depression, I will show up to class and feel better.</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lv4fvq9"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Educational-Laugh773">Educational-Laugh773</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lv4fvq9/">Sat 2024-11-02 at 20:59</a> (3) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_luv6sl4" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_luqadd8" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lv4fvq9" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lv4fvq9)">◯</a></header><p>I started raising monarch butterflies:) season is basically over but I had so much fun doing it.

When I was really broke, I used paper grocery bags that I had rinsed, crumpled up several times, and then taped them flat to dry.

I have a gargoyle that one of my kids made 20 years ago.  I remember they even made octopus tentacle gauges, too. Maybe you could make some Christmas ornaments.  I would pick a block of one color, and paint your creations after you fire them. </p></p><p><p>What about bird or animal watching when you take a walk? </p></p><p><p>Gardening?

Let them spend some time in the kids area, and then pick yourself some books. And you can learn about something that sounds interesting to you. Also, you can check out e- books online. </p></p><p><p>Woodworking, wood burning,  model building, dioramas, there's all kinds of stuff. </p></p><p><p>Maybe start with cardboard crafts if money is an issue.

I suffer from depression and while I won't say it's a cure in any way, I find it slightly hypnotic to go through the process of sorting the pieces and methodically trying different pieces in each slot. There's a...forced slowness to it. It's soothing. Bonus points that I'm focused on a brightly lit dining room table and not how dark it is early this time of year! (I'm in Minnesota.)</p></p><p><p>ETA: Another way I'm made this hobby more enjoyable: there are places that will turn photos into puzzles, so you can put together a puzzle of a favorite memory. Or I buy puzzles when I travel, so I get to reminisce about a vacation while I'm working through it.

It’s similar to regular journaling in that you can theme each piece on an emotion or day you had, but instead of writing it all out you create collages or drawings, use magazine clippings or stickers mixed with words, “black out poetry”, or whatever you feel like that day. It can be an inexpensive hobby if you just use a regular ol’ moleskin journal as a base and just use whatever supplies you have on hand! “Junk journaling” is another name for it, but to a more extreme degree where you literally throw anything into the journal, meaning ticket stubs, envelopes as pockets, little trinkets like candy wrappers, whatever to get the same effect. You can go to Pinterest, Instagram, or google and search “junk journaling” or “art journal” to get more ideas. You mentioned having kids too, so you can toss in anything they have lying around to use like drawings or stickers, use their markers or any art supplies to lessen the cost as well.</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lut30kg"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Lb147">Lb147</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lut30kg/">Thu 2024-10-31 at 21:50</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lut22yf" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lut3wv3" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lut30kg" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lut30kg)">◯</a></header><p>Fly tying for Fly Fishing.

OP is looking for something for the evenings so I’m not sure it works, but putting out feeders and water features with heaters for birds in the winter will bring all kinds of birds to OP. I love watching father birds teach their young how to do things. Or mated birds feeding each other. Or hummingbird males fighting (and buying more hummingbird feeders). If not many birds come at first, don’t despair. Birds will learn that your house is a good place to stop as they migrate. They remember and teach their young. </p></p><p><p>OP’s children will also benefit enormously from learning about the birds. My own kid became a very skilled birder. </p></p><p><p>There are Christmas bird counts where people search designated areas to see what birds are declining and which populations are growing. </p></p><p><p>Also OP can start listing the birds you see and keeping life lists. </p></p><p><p>On the weekend OP can take your kids on short walks to go birding.

It can help you gain some poetry writing skills and understanding of lyric structures.</p></p><p><p>i don't think a.i generators are a "threat" to real artists. i believe that it is a myth. I've been generating a.i songs for almost a year and i still purchase real music at stores and thrift shops. I don't think that my a.i song "my girlfriend has a mole on her left elbow" is really a song that people would want to hear or purchase. So if you do choose a.i music as a thing to keep busy, do not expect to get any fiancial gain from it or fame. You'd be doing it for your own personal enjoyment. Also, you really don't need to share a.i generated songs with anybody. You can simply just generate the songs for your own private listening.</p></p><p><p>It is really no different then creating music as a hobby using DAW software such as FL studio (which is also something I enjoy using)</p></p><p><p>In theory if you purchase a very high quality DAW software, and you have the tools and skills, you can create music that is very simular to a.i generated songs. It just takes longer and requires high quality mixing daw software.</p></p><p><p>I will suggest if it is up your ally, go and give it a try, especially when you are bored.</p></p><p><p>You can give it a try <a href="http://suno.com/">suno.com</a> suno will give you some free credits to generate a couple of songs daily.</p></p><p><p>fl studio is at <a href="https://www.image-line.com/">https://www.image-line.com/</a> You can do some stuff with the trial and free version.</p></p><p><p>the mobile app for this daw is at <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fl-studio-mobile/id432850619">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fl-studio-mobile/id432850619</a></p></p><p><p>the suno reddit is at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SunoAI/">https://www.reddit.com/r/SunoAI/</a></p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lutrhva"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/LittleFirestone">LittleFirestone</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lutrhva/">Fri 2024-11-01 at 02:10</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lutqhdn" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lutsj4x" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lutrhva" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lutrhva)">◯</a></header><p>Save a little money, get a motorbike.

Also, art / street photography.</p></p><p><p>Fair disclaimer I am quite heavily vested in the gear for these hobbies but you dont need to do the same.</p></p><p><p>Eg. <br><strong>Music</strong> - you can frankly start with whatever set of speakers or headphones you have but my whole "meditation" phase comes to life when I silence the world using noise cancellation and listen to hi-res songs using iMusic paired with LDAC enabled headphones like Sony XM4 on my phone or my Hifimann Sundara on PC.</p></p><p><p>I like to hear every detail of the song, the deeper I concentrate there, the calmer my heart feels.</p></p><p><p>If you dont understand any of what I said, don't worry - just close your eyes, grab a quiet corner and focus on the music of your favourite tracks.

It's just a journey which takes you to places you didn't know existed.</p></p><p><p>I have professional grade cameras but my cheap ass instax sq6 film camera remains my most go to pick for this.</p></p><p><p>There is something about hard printed pictures, when you click them, they give you a sense of joy and a gush of emotions - it's almost like you have been transcended to somewhere out of this world. And that's why its like therapy when you start to notice the small nuances of everyday life.</p></p><p><p>Also the instant print cameras like the SQ6 are quite unforgiving and thus they have their own charm. Most of their pictures are imperfect - just like life. And thus you will find yourself laughing at them, a lot.</p></p><p><p><strong>For art</strong> - I think its the easiest of all 3 - take any piece of paper, any type of colors or pencils you can get your hands on, and just start drawing. Anything goes. Somedays I make a beautiful painting of a memory when I first went rafting. Other days - its just a bunch of meaningless lines drawn over and over till you see the page tearing apart. Both are equally beautiful and calming.</p></p><p><p>So yeah those were my 2 cents, I hope you find your peace brother :))</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lutvsmf"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/kristend92">kristend92</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lutvsmf/">Fri 2024-11-01 at 03:03</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lutv34o" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lutw0j8" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lutvsmf" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lutvsmf)">◯</a></header><p>I also reccomend crochet.

You can also branch out into leather and felt burning using the same tools</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_luu3sk8"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/amberallday">amberallday</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/luu3sk8/">Fri 2024-11-01 at 04:31</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_luu3lpw" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_luu3y1s" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_luu3sk8" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_luu3sk8)">◯</a></header><p>Colouring! </p></p><p><p>When I was severely depressed, I bought some kids colouring books (good quality paper - the cheap paper isn’t as enjoyable to use). </p></p><p><p>The grown up colouring books are nice, but I didn’t have the motivation to complete something complex at that stage - kids colouring was about the right size. </p></p><p><p>It’s a nice “mindful” activity - as in, you can just zone into doing the colouring, and stop thinking about other things for a little while. </p></p><p><p>Also - I chose to intentionally do “alternative colours” (eg pink clouds and purple grass) because otherwise I could get stuck trying to choose all the best colours from my set of pens in advance for the picture (eg “if I use this shade of blue here then I don’t have a different one to use there”) - choosing to be more random was very freeing, I found. </p></p><p><p>I still do colouring now I’m out of that period of my life - but more detailed stuff that I’m happy to spend longer on (but also less often).</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_luu3y1s"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Adamcp2013">Adamcp2013</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/luu3y1s/">Fri 2024-11-01 at 04:32</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_luu3sk8" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_luu4p5e" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_luu3y1s" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_luu3y1s)">◯</a></header><p>Yoga</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_luu4p5e"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/ireadtheartichoke">ireadtheartichoke</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/luu4p5e/">Fri 2024-11-01 at 04:40</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_luu3y1s" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_luu5dx2" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_luu4p5e" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_luu4p5e)">◯</a></header><p>Disc golf.

Books based on true events, especially American history for me gives me a type of hobby to learn more about our country. Interesting perspectives that our country has been thru all types of good and bad, ups and down and we are still here. Also that life is bigger than just us but yet it is still important for each of us to contribute- even with something as simple as holding a door/being kind and respectful to ALL. While time might be a challenge finding ways to support a worthy cause, doing things for others in addition to self care are ways to help shift our thoughts and worth. My father coped with his grief when my mother died by working (even 1 shift couple hrs) in kitchen feeding the needy, and that type of thinking/action has helped me as I deal with my stage 4 cancer (same that took my mother).

If your post accurately describes your state of mind, the tell is all the negativity.  For example, you “can’t play instruments, etc.” Not saying that learning a musical instrument is for you, but has it occurred to you that no one could play a musical instrument before his first lesson? If you love music, you assuredly CAN learn to play an instrument. With respect, you might want to consider that your depression and resulting negativity is what’s holding you back. “The Power of Positive Thinking” has helped millions of people. Positivity leads to positive results. We all fall into negativity. Especially in depression. But you can scrape and scratch your way out by learning to think positively. And then listen to your heart for a hobby that grabs you and embrace it as though your life depends on it.<br>Second, being of service to others not only helps the others, but brings up my spirits.

Art is something that people are intrinsically drawn to (think cave paintings, little kids drawing, etc). </p></p><p><p>I absolutely recommend stamp carving, it's cheap to get started and takes really no skill. You can get a cheap speedball brand carving set from Amazon (it's a little red plastic handle that stores a few different sized carving tips), a box of pink rubber erasers (also cheap on Amazon), a sharpie (for drawing your design), paper, and a stamping ink pad. That's all you need. Then just draw a little thing on an eraser (smiley face, flower, eyeball, etc), either carve out the lines you drew, or carve around the design, then stamp it on some paper and admire the little thing you created. You can store the stamps in the box the erasers came in, so no big space requirements.</p></p><p><p>The reason I like this hobby so much is that there's no real rhyme or reason to it, and no real end-game. Unlike drawing/painting, there's very low risk involved with it. If it doesn't look how you hoped, no big deal, it's just a silly little thing you created! If it turns out how you hoped, woohoo, you have this cool little thing you can frame/put on your fridge.  Best part is that it's really easy to pick up/put down. Plus you can store the items in a little box or bag and take it wherever you are. </p></p><p><p>Stamp carving is the ONLY task that turns my thoughts off, it's very meditative for me.

There's some truth to that and it can fit a vast variety of interest level from casual to serious study.</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_luvleqj"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/MI963">MI963</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/luvleqj/">Fri 2024-11-01 at 10:13</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_luvkig6" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_luvm14l" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_luvleqj" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_luvleqj)">◯</a></header><p>Gardening - even in a few containers inside if necessary (old milk container, boxes)</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_luvm14l"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Natetronn">Natetronn</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/luvm14l/">Fri 2024-11-01 at 10:16</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_luvleqj" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_luvm3c5" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_luvm14l" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_luvm14l)">◯</a></header><p>Have you considered volunteering with your local Hospice?

Keeps my hands and mind focused and busy. You can do decent work with entry level or secondhand tools - my most expensive purchase when I started was my axe, like $200 but you can find them in antique and pawn for way less, like $20-50, and knives can be cheap especially if you’re willing to learn how to sharpen (which is meditative and focused as well.) I’ve bought and sharpened bags of random gouges and chisels that were like $2 for a handful of tools, prior to getting a good hook. I’ve used the same axe for over 6 or 7 years now, and only recently upgraded my beavercraft knives. There’s something really special about holding a finished spoon though, and cooking with it or gifting it.

Using an app that has a steak count also helped with feeling like I accomplished a little bit that day even if I hadn’t gotten out of bed and gave me something to look forward to everyday.

Plenty of great books for free at public library. Librarians love to help people out. Nothing like a hard copy, turning pages by hand totally disconnected.  Have you ever watched a pro shoot 9 bal or straight pool? Art supplies can cost a fortune but sketching with pencil and paper and working on technique instead of collecting tubes of oil and brushes is not so much $.  Adult coloring books are a legit thing to look into. Keep trying new things and you'll find something that is only mastered by your work and dedication and not simply bought.  Sometimes folks can't play the piano because they're hidden saxophonists. You gotta try a couple instruments sometimes. Singing is cheaper than a guitar pick! I'd also like to point out that many hobbies and activities are affordable if you don't get hung up on all the unnecessary gear.

I’ve been off meds for like 7-8 years now and it’s actually been okay, but there’s obviously been episodes I couldn’t snap out of with the usual remedies. I don’t think anyone suggested it to me so I have no idea where I got the idea, but somehow I ended up painting rocks. I’ve never been artistic or even a very good drawer/painter so it was awkward at first. I dabbled with regular acrylic paints and eventually with paint pens as well. The process of finding nice flat rocks in different sizes, finding something I felt like painting, the actual painting, and then seeing the finished product has been the perfect distraction for me in my darker days. I’ve been doing it for maybe 3ish years now and I have absolutely improved my drawing and painting skills to the point where people offer to pay for my rocks! What’s funny is that I tend to enjoy painting dark humor puns, inappropriate things, or just weird shit more than anything and never expected anyone else to even see them.</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_luxphme"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/SocietyOk1173">SocietyOk1173</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/luxphme/">Fri 2024-11-01 at 17:04</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_luxp7ra" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_luxppkw" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_luxphme" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_luxphme)">◯</a></header><p>Watch old movies and write your thoughts about them in a notebook.</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_luxppkw"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Specific-Fox8291">Specific-Fox8291</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/luxppkw/">Fri 2024-11-01 at 17:05</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_luxphme" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_luxpvd5" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_luxppkw" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_luxppkw)">◯</a></header><p>Darts!!</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_luxpvd5"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/nedford5">nedford5</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/luxpvd5/">Fri 2024-11-01 at 17:06</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_luxppkw" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_luxpwqj" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_luxpvd5" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_luxpvd5)">◯</a></header><p>Contrary to popular belief black smithing can initially be impactful for this as well.

Not like a pottery wheel kind of clay, but the colored clay you can bake in your oven, like Femo. I like to make props for my SIL who does cosplay. I also like to juggle, usually with some sort of upbeat pop music or electronic music playing to keep time. It's like riding a stationary bike; a great workout but you can do it in a very small area. I juggle until I'm panting and I feel like my arms are going to fall off. Great hit of exercise-induced dopamine and I sleep better. If you're into being around people while depressed, a weekly D&amp;D session or chess match with friends (or even online) can also work wonders and you really don't have to spend all that much beyond a few sets of dice or a cheap chess set. Sometimes I stress bake. A sack of flour, a sack of sugar, some vanilla and eggs and the internet can go pretty far. Also if you're going to stress eat, you might as well learn how to cook said comfort foods.</p></p><p><p>For ADHD blender brain, I force myself into a hyperfocus by doing something very small and dexterous, like cross-stitching or taking a seam ripper to an old, worn out garment. </p></p><p><p>Hope any of this helps!</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_luy729g"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/New_Section_9374">New_Section_9374</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/luy729g/">Fri 2024-11-01 at 18:51</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_luy6z59" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_luy786r" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_luy729g" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_luy729g)">◯</a></header><p>Free painting.

I made a YouTube music Playlist with all the songs that lift my mood, so, music is non-stop in my ears. Next, I started rucking on my treadmill with a backpack with books holding at 26.5lbs. This has slimmed me down, and I have fun basically doing that and anything around the house because sweeping, mopping, folding clothes, making dinner, etc., have all become a safe haven for me to get zoned into my music and get a singular focused mindset going, and it helps my anxiety a lot.

Consider woodworking, starting with hand tools.  You only need a few, not horribly expensive tools to get started.  The skills and knowledge from that will get you started on a pretty good long term path for it as a hobby, and you can expand to more and more expensive tools as you learn and decide you need them.   A hatchet, a hand saw, a chisel and a hand plane, and a brace and bit, are more than enough to start, and even do some really nice pieces.  You can get all but the brace and bits at home depot for about $20 each.  The first things you do are start making other things you need, like a bench, mallets, ways to clamp and hold things.  You can spend a lot of money on this stuff.  Or you can spend time, learning how it was done, before the invention of all this stuff.</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lv0ite9"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/CaramelMartini">CaramelMartini</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lv0ite9/">Sat 2024-11-02 at 07:30</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lv0ggos" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lv0jhw5" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lv0ite9" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lv0ite9)">◯</a></header><p>Martial arts. </p></p><p><p>It’s so, so satisfying.

There's this whole thing about locking in scores, but you could tweak your own system and just go by a weekly average score for each player (against the different "teams" that were created in the mock draft - cuz you see them all).

You don't have to do it for very long and it doesn't have to be fancy or ornate. The other aspect is you can pick it up and put it down when you need to and you have something to show for your time. <br>   Picking up a crochet hook or a couple of knitting needles and some yarn at a thrift store or rummage sale is a very cheap way to start. It is addicting and eventually you may find others to connect to to just come together for an hour or two and craft; it's a great escape without having to talk about emotional problems and issues but have a sense of community in fact taking a break from your problems for that time. Social connection is also a big element of reducing effects of depression.</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lv0xgsn"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/HelloCannon">HelloCannon</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lv0xgsn/">Sat 2024-11-02 at 08:58</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lv0x2ul" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lv0xh81" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lv0xgsn" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lv0xgsn)">◯</a></header><p>Look up USPSA.

And the best thing is that you don’t need a lot of accessories to do them. They all come with the canvas, the diamonds (also called drills), a pen, wax pads to put the diamonds on the canvas, and a tray to pick them up from. You can buy them starting under $5; the larger and more complex, the more they cost but I’ve never seen them over $20. And if you really enjoy them, you can get more accessories to make it easier.

I use to be a competitive runner, but after taking time off from running due to an injury in my 30’s I have struggled with getting back to running (I still enjoy it, but I crave the competition and I can’t really compete anymore and 5Ks don’t really do it for me- I injuries myself on mile 12 while training for a marathon). My husband tried to get me into disc golf, which was fine but I found I just enjoyed being outside, so in the last year or so we have started doing ALOT of day hikes. There are some really amazing trails about 45 minutes from where we live (that’s my favorite place to hike, but we can’t make it every weekend) our small town has a wooded hiking trail system, it’s pretty small, but there are some hills take make it more challenging. When ever I am feeling down- I know I need to go for a hike and connect with nature. Plus, depending on your kids ages they might enjoy it too. You can have them look for different leaves and do crafts with the things they find out in nature. The hiking trails in our town also have some fishing spots, so if your family is into that (grant it that would cost money) you could go fishing for a little while when out hiking.</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lv201re"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Indyopenmind">Indyopenmind</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lv201re/">Sat 2024-11-02 at 12:25</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lv1ze7i" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lv20d33" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lv201re" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lv201re)">◯</a></header><p>Get yourself a Pioneer Flex 2 controller and start streaming music from home.

I’ve been going 4-6 times a week for months now and really enjoy it; I actually miss it if I don’t go for more than a couple of days in a row. It’s different every time, exercises muscles in ways the gym never did, helps relax my body and reduce my anxiety with its focus on stretching, balance, and breathing, and allows me to not think about anything else for at least an hour a day. You can’t think about anything else because you’re so busy listening to the instructor and trying to follow the complex directions (e.g., “Balance the ball between your left knee and your left elbow while pushing the platform away from the foot bar with the arch of your right foot, remembering to inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth and keep your hips level.”). I’ve made a couple of new friends through the classes, as well and even discovered that a few coworkers also attend some of the  classes.

They can get kinda pricey with new ones and all the junk with em, but I started with a bunch of second hands that had gone through the wringer already; and then I put em through it again/still am. For me when they’re up, it’s kinda thrilling and humbling at the same time. Keeping a constant eye on it and everything around that could be a hazard depending on where I’m at, flying a fuckin plane and having a great ass time, and also considering you can’t go too high, but want to stay higher up for fun maneuvers/failure and recovery. It’s a skill and a challenge for sure given wind, the planes themselves, your remote and its type/sensitivity. I love it, and so far I crash at least one every time (I’m still a beginner). Because they’re foamies you can just glue and popsicle stick them back up (for the most part) and keep flying after curing times.

A rotary cutter, cutting mat and sewing machine are about all you need.</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lv36uv9"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/cora-14">cora-14</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lv36uv9/">Sat 2024-11-02 at 16:21</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lv33f7o" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lv36w25" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lv36uv9" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lv36uv9)">◯</a></header><p>Crochet!</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lv36w25"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Zealousideal_Escape9">Zealousideal_Escape9</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lv36w25/">Sat 2024-11-02 at 16:22</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lv36uv9" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lv37ovz" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lv36w25" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lv36w25)">◯</a></header><p>Woobles!

Did anyone mention drawing and painting? I'm more of a painter myself. And buying supplies on Amazon don't really cost much. All that's needed is an inexpensive set of brushes, a set of acrylics, and a mixed media sketchbook with paper thick enough (higher gsm is best) for painting. Brushes can be washed in dish soap and water to get out the paint when finished. You can even buy a pack of small already gessoed canvases for cheap. People sometimes think you have to be like a Da Vinci to do artwork. But the fun thing is that it takes no skill whatsoever. Just let your mind wander and do geometric shapes, abstract marks, anything really, no rules. It's just lines and colors. And many use artwork as a form of therapy. I've met numerous people who started painting when they were older. One guy actually had a studio in Charleston, SC. He retired and suddenly decided to pick up painting and found out he enjoyed it and was very talented. Maybe I missed something and you've already tried it? If not, never know til you give it a shot.</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lv4noed"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/(deleted)">(deleted)</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lv4noed/">Sat 2024-11-02 at 21:55</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lv4mzoq" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lv4ogrx" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lv4noed" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lv4noed)">◯</a></header><p>I am a hobbyist photographer and what is nice about this, is that you can get outside in the fresh air and learn to take some interesting shots.</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lv4ogrx"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/scumbagsuperstar">scumbagsuperstar</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lv4ogrx/">Sat 2024-11-02 at 22:01</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lv4noed" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lv4p12n" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lv4ogrx" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lv4ogrx)">◯</a></header><p>book nook kits</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lv4p12n"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Useful-Badger-4062">Useful-Badger-4062</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lv4p12n/">Sat 2024-11-02 at 22:06</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lv4ogrx" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lv4phs5" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lv4p12n" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lv4p12n)">◯</a></header><p>I do a lot of art hobbies and really enjoy studying different cultures’ decorative painting styles.

And eventually move upto larger pieces or just get really good at the small things</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lv5fykg"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/kari_is_">kari_is_</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lv5fykg/">Sun 2024-11-03 at 01:40</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lv5f7g0" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lv5giiv" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lv5fykg" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lv5fykg)">◯</a></header><p>i my brother developed depression in his teens and found enjoyment in drama first in building the sets then screenwriting and finally acting. he later picked up a pricey(imo) hobby  of a role play card game called magic cards. like dungeons and dragons  but on cards. until now he and his friends meet every monday to play.  there's a whole community behind this game. local matches  and large competitions guys offered my brother hundreds  off dollars to buy the deck he made bc he always won with it i said omfg so is dinner on you?! he laughed and said no he declined the offer. bc some cards are special short term releases  so he'd never be able to curate the same deck again. and it's all strategy which i suck at so i only tried playing once and did not make it past one round. i enjoy pop culture quite a bit so i love streaming new stuff  and  remembering each actor's name  and i can't do anything else unless i get it right. i refuse to google a single one.   it's weird and doesn't probably count as a hobby but it's still a mind exercise that redirects my energy to something joyful bc it feels like such a win when i get it right</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lv5giiv"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/kari_is_">kari_is_</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lv5giiv/">Sun 2024-11-03 at 01:47</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lv5fykg" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lv5gzpe" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lv5giiv" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lv5giiv)">◯</a></header><p>have you tried pets as therapy? funny enough my SIL has a parrot and to keep her as close to her natural environment as possible she hides  her food in puzzle games so she must forage  to eat like she would in the wild.    but i feel bad for the fucker  knowing how hangry i sure as hell would bd in its shoes so i  feed it when she's not looking lol</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lv5gzpe"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/kari_is_">kari_is_</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lv5gzpe/">Sun 2024-11-03 at 01:53</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lv5giiv" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lv5kvyg" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lv5gzpe" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lv5gzpe)">◯</a></header><p>i online communities like this are a good  hobby though not in a traditional sense. i'm not 38F   but in my early 20s chatroulette was my hobby.</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lv5kvyg"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/benny_k99">benny_k99</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lv5kvyg/">Sun 2024-11-03 at 02:39</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lv5gzpe" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lv5ppkw" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lv5kvyg" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lv5kvyg)">◯</a></header><p>il give you one not to try....golf....save yourself the pain.

I feel like you have tried a bunch of different shit and do quite a lot of things already.  I hate it when I say it, but I’m gonna have to say it…”when I was your age”…. My life pretty much sucked too.  Then I found alcohol!</p></p><p><p>I was a captain in the Marine Corps, after I turned 30, I was really depressed, a few of my Marines could out run me, maxing out the PT test was getting harder and harder. I had young kids and worked 12 hr days more often than not.</p></p><p><p>I had always enjoyed alcohol, but felt like I should ramp it up a little more.  Drinking heavily brought a new level of clarity to my life.  I was flying helicopters and didn’t know it at the time but had ADD really bad.  The only time I was happy, is when I was in the cockpit with a high workload.</p></p><p><p>So when I got off work I just started drinking heavily and slowed my world down enough to really evaluate my life.  I found out that I actually hated my wife.  I know, hate is such a strong word… but when I started realizing the fantasy of killing her was getting stronger and more compelling. I knew it was time for a change.</p></p><p><p>So judging from all the things you do now and all the things you have either tried or evaluated.  Maybe you should remove some things from your life, or remove yourself from some things…. So it might be that you are depressed because something is making you depressed.  In my case, it was my miserable wife who didn’t work, was a stay at home mom, lived in a 4 bedroom colonial in the DC suburbs, and still wasn’t happy unless I was miserable, so I got rid of her and things really started looking up!</p></p><p><p>You are welcome</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lv5ro80"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/hangingsocks">hangingsocks</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lv5ro80/">Sun 2024-11-03 at 03:54</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lv5qi8o" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lv5shp0" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lv5ro80" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lv5ro80)">◯</a></header><p>I have gotten really into baking.  Started with sourdough. There are so many online communities that have advice and recipes, I am always able to find something to read .  Then I started doing the discard recipes.  You feed the sourdough starter but so it doesn't get too big you dump out excess.  I use that excess to make flour tortillas, bagels, pizza dough, cookies, yeasted bread, and so much more.  I have never had a hobby really.  Last week my husband and I were on vacation and he asked me if I missed baking.  And I really really did!  Plus I never want to buy tortillas or bagels ever again. What I make is a thousand times better and healthier then what's in the store.  My body feels better.  And even though I am having more bread products, I have lost weight.   So this hobby has been an all around win.  And my husband, friends, family and neighbors are all VERY happy with it too.</p></p><p><p>I also took seeing classes and love it!  My issue is I haven't been able to set up a space for it yet.  But I hope to soon.</p></p><p><p>Both of these seem to quiet my mind and make me relax and focus.

I get the weird / unusual creatures like the pistol shrimp who has a symbiotic relationship with a fish who walks him around the tank and fetches food for him. In my freshwater, I’ve got a black ghost knife fish, truly the most mesmerizing to watch so far. It’s a super fun hobby; and you can make it as simple or as challenging as you want. I started with a 10 gal freshwater with a bunch of neon tetras and algae eating shrimps. And snails! Can’t forget the little water cows!. I’ve now got hybrid purple mystery snails after my blue and burgundy mated!. Just don’t forget the quick start stuff to speed up the water cycle so you can get fish right away. </p></p><p><p>It’s got aspects in so many areas: you’re caring for living things which is rewarding by itself. It piques interest and curiosity. And I personally believe with many fish, their intelligence is underrated. I even had a blenny who would watch tv with me. I have an eel who likes to watch / chase bubbles from the turkey baster. I have little crabs who get excited and wave their claws around trying to climb onto my hand if I’m adjusting a coral or some rocks. Fiddler crabs dance. I have a clown fish who slaps me with water by whipping his tail at me, because he doesn’t like my hand in the tank. I could keep going, it’s just such a neat hobby!!</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lv6c84d"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/kevingfrank">kevingfrank</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lv6c84d/">Sun 2024-11-03 at 06:39</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lv6bi5n" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lv6c9ml" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lv6c84d" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lv6c84d)">◯</a></header><p>Honestly, if you’re able to and like animals, for me it was fostering kittens.

Finding a hobby is good, but from what you’re saying it sounds like you’re looking for the next dopamine hit. You need to talk to somebody about what’s bothering you instead of just looking for the next “thing”. </p></p><p><p>That being said, I know where you’re coming from. If you truly want a new hobby, I’d recommend photography. Look up places you can go and take pictures and edit them. You can just use your phone. Don’t know how to edit? Look up basic tutorials on YouTube. When you do this, every where you go you can take a picture of something you see that catches your eye. Then before you know it, you have a portfolio of things you’ve seen that you found remarkable and can print out and show friends and family. This is my best advice.</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lv6dgt8"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/LowlyMaid">LowlyMaid</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lv6dgt8/">Sun 2024-11-03 at 06:47</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lv6cy4k" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lv6e4cp" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lv6dgt8" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lv6dgt8)">◯</a></header><p>Getting out of the house helps me.

If the worst thing that I do in a funk is build and decorate 4 houses, it's much better than any of my alternatives. It distracts me from the dark space I'm in and it gives me control over something. There are also challenges in the game now, which I never use, if it feels a little mundane. There's custom content you can add, but as with all mods some may be buggy, and slow down your computer. At one point the base game was free, and it might still be? </p></p><p><p>What about trying to start some plants from seed? All you *should* need is a pot, some soil, seeds, sunshine, and water. And maybe having a backup plant that's already living in case the seed doesn't germinate and send you into a failure spiral.  Gardening and being outside helped me so much this summer.  I would walk around for like 45 minutes just to look at, water, prune my flowers, and I have killed every indoor plant I have ever gotten. It was really cool seeing these plants grow and seeing the progress after a few days.  </p></p><p><p>I also love rocks/minerals/crystals/gemstones but that can get expensive. I don't go by the whole metaphysial and vibrations stuff, just the beauty.

It's also so grounding to sit and look at the layers, sparkles, all from different angles.  So if you don't want to spend money, maybe watching videos about rocks?

I’m going through a rough patch mentally and needed something low impact to keep me busy in the evenings. My boyfriend collects pokemon, so I thought I’d give the Lorcana Disney cards a try. I will buy a pack ($6) once in awhile and then sit and organize my cards in a binder. For me I just like the process of sorting out all my favorite “pretty” cards and characters and then putting them together in my binder however it looks best to me. Bonus points for me: it’s also been a good regression activity that helps me unlock that innocent childish side and forget I’m a depressed stressed adult for awhile since it’s just me and my pretty little Disney characters. I’ve also found it’s kind of an exciting little thing for me. I look forward to getting a new pack and seeing what I got.

It was such a nostalgic game for me growing up and have always loved loved loved playing it. Specifically it’s a memory I have with my step dad and we would smoke and just play for hours. After I got my setup and started playing again I also found out there is still a community of people like me who still love the retro game and it really helped me get back into it. Maybe picking up something nostalgic that you used to love as a kid/teen would help? And maybe whatever that is still has a community out there that also loves the same thing. I’ve also gotten into plants and went from 1 to 40 plants in a year from enjoying them so much. They may just seem pretty to look at but there is a lot of work and care. Plus it’s such a good feeling seeing a new leaf pop up or overall growth overtime. I also have gotten into crafting and trying to find something I can make that I love myself and could possibly sell as a side hustle. Since I love plants and wanted something to “do” to feel like my life was more than just work and chores- I decided my craft would be plant hangers. I made them for myself and have actually sold a few online as well. My depression was the worst when I felt like my life was on a sad cycle of the Truman show. Work, chores, sleep, repeat. But finding something that I could make and feel accomplished outside of work has significantly helped me.</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lv877r6"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/South_Opportunity_52">South_Opportunity_52</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lv877r6/">Sun 2024-11-03 at 12:29</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lv86w26" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lv8arpm" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lv877r6" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lv877r6)">◯</a></header><p>Working out</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lv8arpm"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/CommunicationKnown31">CommunicationKnown31</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lv8arpm/">Sun 2024-11-03 at 12:47</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lv877r6" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lv8eofq" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lv8arpm" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lv8arpm)">◯</a></header><p>Get into a natural health kick.

Puzzles are great, counted cross stitch (if you're just getting into it you can find a ton that have the image printed so it's easier to follow along), crochet is fairly easy to learn and you can take it anywhere. I picked up quilting a couple years ago and it's been amazing for my mental health but, it can get a little on the expensive side and then you'll have to figure out what to do with the finished pieces (donating, gifts, selling, although it's difficult to sell). If you're getting bored with reading, maybe try a new genre? Coloring can be great too. Also, cleaning/organizing. Idk about you but with my kids there's always something to clean, for me, while I sometimes dread it, I ALWAYS feel better while I'm cleaning/organizing and then the dopamine hit from finishing it is always good. </p></p><p><p>I hope that among the multitude of suggestions you're able to find something that works for you.

I’d get home from work and go ride for an hour or so until dark. It changed my life. Now that I’m old I still ride. I’ve never ridden a bike to race, just enjoyment and physical activity. Over time it got easier and I eventually got into doing long overnight trips that included camping and hotel stays. I’ve ridden my bicycle many thousands of miles across parts of the US and Canada. You don’t have to spend huge amounts of money to buy a bicycle but you do need one that fits you properly. Bicycle touring opens many doors. There are several organizations you can join. Adventurecycling.org is one based in Montana. Many towns and cities are making ongoing improvements to bicycle infrastructure that make it easier and safer. Riding has also opened other areas of interest such as photography, mechanics, navigation and riding in charity events. It’s a great way to stay fit and explore. Try it!</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lv8tmre"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/FeelingCareless6751">FeelingCareless6751</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lv8tmre/">Sun 2024-11-03 at 14:23</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lv8sycq" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lv8u6en" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lv8tmre" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lv8tmre)">◯</a></header><p>Coloring.

A lot of people shit on running but nothing helps release endorphins more than a good run. Also, it’s intense enough that you can reap the benefits from just doing a 1/2-1 mile. The endorphin rush makes me feel good even if I had a bad run. Also, I feel more productive after running. I’ve done lifting and gymnastics, but I think that mentally running gives me the most benefits. I know you said exercise hasn’t worked, but try to find a way to stay active that you can be consistent with. </p></li><br><li><p>Pets. I got an axolotl and it gave me a new sense of purpose and made me feel needed. Obviously don’t bring a living creature into your life that you aren’t in a good place mentally to take care of, but I found that having a pet shows you the importance of taking care of yourself (cleaning, feeding, personal happiness). It puts self care into perspective, because you’d feel like a shit person if you didn’t feed/care for your pet, so why would you do that to yourself? I feel like I’m taking care of myself better and I have something to look forward to when I get home. I know you said you can’t take care of pets, so maybe you could reap these same benefits from volunteering at an animal shelter?  </p></li><br><li><p>Cleaning/cooking. This sounds really lame but I feel like having a clean home makes my mental health so much better. Also, cooking stimulates some kind of good feeling of chemical, the food just feels more filling and tasty when you make it yourself. I’ve really been into making masaman curry and premade spinach ravioli. Also, muffins are super easy to make. </p></li><br></ol></p><p><p>I hope this helped, sorry that I listed a ton of things that you said you ruled out already.

Even when I felt stuck or down, looking for caches forced me to focus on my surroundings and made everyday places feel new and exciting.

Some people do it solo, while others enjoy bringing a friend along, so it’s flexible based on your preferences.</p></p><p><p>If night is the only time you have, there are even “night caches” specifically designed to be found in the dark, which adds a unique and almost magical element to the experience.

A free app will get you started, and a smartphone flashlight is usually enough for nighttime hunts.</p></p><p><p>Geocaching helped me in a way that felt playful yet grounding.

The nice thing is trees can be pretty forgiving and cheap to make mistakes, learn and try again if you keep it low-key, and gardening in permaculture style makes it more loose and experimental, no big deal if something doesn't work out or gets neglected for a bit.

It is expensive, but hey, you can fly wing tip to wing tip with a seagull on your personal fabric aircraft that fits in a backpack, it's fucking BAD. ASS. </p></p><p><p>Also mountain biking! Or road biking. Let that be a gateway to bikepacking. Bikepacking is the distilled essence of adventure. </p></p><p><p>Or, total curve ball here, get yourself Ben Eater's 6502 Breadboard computer kit and make yourself a retro computer! You'll learn a lot about electronics and programming in what I think is a really engaging way. We're constantly surrounded by computers now, and I've found it really rewarding to know more about how they work. The objects my life revolves around should not be mysteries. Or get into robotics. Pick up an Arduino and start making some stuff! You could make some silly little robots for your kids.</p></p><p><p>Oh, another curveball! Try out something like VCV Rack. It's software modular synthesis that's free. Make interesting weird noises and electronic music! It's really fun. On a similar note, you could get into generative visual art with something like Processing or Touch Designer! Or SharderToy.</p></p><p><p>Oh you could also learn Blender and make animations or art, or learn another CAD tool and design things to 3D print.</p></p><p><p>I think the best hobbies are ones where you develop knowledge or skills that enrich your life and open up new possibilities for you. Now don't get me wrong, I fully enjoy a video game from time to time, but they've never been satisfying in the way that biking, flying, woodworking, or programming have for me. I think the problem for me is that with something like video games, you're not engaging with the world, but with other hobbies you can. And again please don't take this wrong, I think video games are one of the most expressive forms of art we've ever developed. I think they're more just entertainment in my mind, and at least for me, hobbies are distinct from entertainment. They are absolutely entertaining, but I think a fundamental difference is that they are creative, not just consumptive. Like when I go on a backpacking trip I create a new part of my personal narrative, and when I woodwork, I create an object that incarnates the skills I have developed. For me at least, it's those aspects of my hobbies that really helped me through the hardest times in my life. And genuinely I went through a few periods where these hobbies saved my life.</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lvb5vk0"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/AdOk3029">AdOk3029</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lvb5vk0/">Sun 2024-11-03 at 23:17</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lvb58y1" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lvb73da" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lvb5vk0" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lvb5vk0)">◯</a></header><p>The more detailed coloring books and set of pretty colored pens or pencils.</p></p><p><p>Or a paint-by-numbers set. </p></p><p><p>Even just free-flow watercolor is nice, or you can follow a tutorial. </p></p><p><p>Art always brings me back to simpler times of childhood, and is a good way to get emotions out ❤️</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lvb73da"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/wholegrainjo">wholegrainjo</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lvb73da/">Sun 2024-11-03 at 23:29</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lvb5vk0" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lvb76cp" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lvb73da" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lvb73da)">◯</a></header><p>Crochet; cheap &amp; if you do granny squares, you can take it with you and do pieces anywhere.

Documentaries, nature shows etc are better choices. Slowly reducing screen time as you do find other interests will definitely help. Making an empact or a difference helps us feel more accomplished and it always feels good. Consider donating your skills &amp; time locally. Heck if money is an issue work a job that gives back while paying you a little-some of the food shelters in my area actually pay folks to work shifts at their store. Church can be a great resource for community needs but there are tons of options. As weird as it sounds I consider my hobby taking care of my home’s upkeep. Everything from daily chores to fixups to calling repair services for things beyond my skills. Landscaping around my home is turning into a big thing for me now too. Planning how everything will look for the upcoming year-making a hand drawn map of everything…. Planning wwhen to remove/prune/transplant/plant/cut/etc. I’ve never really had hobbies but this has became very satisfying. I’m thinking ahead to retirement and what Ill do with my time so I don’t get bored. So far i am considering using my own landscaping skills to donate to other elderly folks who physically can’t do any. I’ve also heard there’s a need for simply transporting folks to doctor appointments and such-helpful stuff I could do that’s not real invasive. Anyway follow your senses. With time you’ll find your own direction. As you carve out your interest the satisfaction will follow. Good luck</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lvbnhpl"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/baczyns">baczyns</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lvbnhpl/">Mon 2024-11-04 at 02:35</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lvbjvob" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lvbnjun" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lvbnhpl" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lvbnhpl)">◯</a></header><p>Genealogy!

Hoping you find your jam.</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lve3hyw"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/travelingcrone70">travelingcrone70</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lve3hyw/">Mon 2024-11-04 at 11:48</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lve2yel" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lve3i31" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lve3hyw" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lve3hyw)">◯</a></header><p>I flip furniture.

What seasons &amp; geography are you working with?</p></p><p><p>I love hiking, for which All Trails is a great place to start. You can even buy a hammock and give your hikes a “mission” by looking for cool new spots to hammock and read, since you enjoy that already- it’s like hobby stacking! </p></p><p><p>If you don’t live somewhere with great nature access, the joys of hiking can be translated to city living by driving to new neighborhoods and going on walks to explore while listening to music or a podcast. You can even do this at dusk/night and take a look at the cool houses and check out people’s interior decorating since the windows are all lit up. </p></p><p><p>I also have recently gotten into rock hounding. Essentially this is walking along beaches and streams looking for cool rocks, which feels dumb until you do some research &amp; start nerding out about geology on different forums. There’s a whole community and they organize massive fossil &amp; rock shows. You can also start watching YouTube videos about wire wrapping so you can make pendants from your finds as gifts for friends, and the supplies are super cheap. Tumblers aren’t too expensive to invest in either if you get into it. This is an easy one to involve the kids in too, which makes it easier to maintain and supports quality time!</p></p><p><p>Photography is another easy one to start, you can just use your phone! Pick a prompt, then stage a shoot during the evening golden hour, and learn how to stylize your pictures at night using a free editing app. I recommend reading The Photographer’s Eye by Michael Freeman to get introduced to basic theories of composition etc. Then you can post the pics on Instagram or a blog like Wordpress (if you wanted to incorporate some writing since you said you enjoy that occasionally), or print them and put together collages or make cards for people, frame them, start recruiting friends &amp; family as models and gifting them headshots. People love seeing their memories documented, it feels special to be able to provide that. Most importantly, scouting for a good photography subject becomes fun motivation to get out and go to places you haven’t been before, and it gets your brain trained to look for the beauty in even your most mundane surroundings. </p></p><p><p>Best of luck!

Look into what nature has to offer in your surrounding areas. Join groups &amp; try your hand at it and see what you find and what you can (safely) create from it.

There are forms of still meditation, but motion meditation is also beneficial. Many folks turn their noise up to things like this quickly, so you're not alone if you do.

You can get patterns online, buy them, or make your own designs. If the counting seems fun to you, but you prefer making something ‘useful’ you can try crochet. Crochet is one hook and yarn. You count stitches, and you can make toys (amurguri), or  clothes, or scarves, or afghans - blankets. When I’m sad, I like to keep my hands busy.

Have you thought about doing something where you are interacting with other guys? Have you tried golf or pickle ball? Both give you an opportunity to play competitively with others and to communicate with someone outside of your normal circle. They are also low risk sports that you shouldn’t have to worry too much about injuring yourself. Or find a meet up that does board games if you like gaming. You still get the competitive challenge, but you are interacting socially with people and gaining some intellectual stimulation in the process. Sometimes we need to find something to get us out of our own head…which is why I avoid things like knitting or crocheting, haha! I joined a board gaming meetup when my husband and I first moved across the country and didn’t know anybody in our new home, and I still am friends with some of those folks after almost 10 years! </p></p><p><p>Or what about cooking? Baking? I’m sure your family would love to be your Guinea Pigs for any baking you wanted to do…extra points of it’s cake and you get into competitive cake decorating 😉. </p></p><p><p>If you prefer to do something totally solitary, maybe consider biking (although you could also join a local biking club). Or swimming; I find it very therapeutic to just get in the groove of swimming laps.  But I find that overall, my mental health really benefits from interactive hobbies- I like aqua aerobics more than swimming laps because there is a social element that gets me out of my own head. I like body pump classes more than weightlifting on my own at the gym for the same reason. </p></p><p><p>Whatever you decide to try, I wish you luck.

I'm a practical person so I'm always making something warm and cozy and useful.</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lvgxrik"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Mean_Watercress5330">Mean_Watercress5330</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lvgxrik/">Mon 2024-11-04 at 21:04</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lvgwt3y" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lvgxsb2" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lvgxrik" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lvgxrik)">◯</a></header><p>I think with any hobbies, try to be patient.

I believe you when you say you are depressed, but I also see lots of excuses as to why you aren’t doing many of these things. You say you can’t play musical instruments…so pick one up and learn how to play. The not wanting to get injured by playing a sport, I understand…but life’s not worth living if you don’t take a risk once in a while. Plus, if you’re just playing a pickup game, you’re probably not going to get hurt. You said writing is enjoyable, but then there was an excuse as to why you don’t/can’t.</p></p><p><p>For me, getting off of screens was step one. I have been going for walks at different area parks on the weekend and leaving my phone in my car. You don’t need your phone. People have been going for walks for ages and ages without them.

Once you get the hoops &amp; string in the initial kit, it is really cheap to get patterns or learn how to make your patterns. I made Monday-Sunday Embroidered dish towels as a kid &amp; still have some of them. My son liked to crochet as a kid, you could do that, or knit, or arm knit (I think that is what it is called). There are videos to teach you how, and you can make beanies to wear, blankets &amp; other things. You can often find yarn on sale at hobby stores, or even at thrift stores for super cheap.

Luckily, I had a dog at the time (miss you Bams 😔) and of course I would come outta my depression pit to care for him and take him outside. His favorite place to poop was next to a pile of landscaping rocks. He liked to take his sweet time so I'd sit on one of the bigger rocks and wait and one day I looked down at all the rocks and I found an agate, those semi translucent rocks with bands. The shit just amazed me, and that began my hobby of rock hounding! I started to discover how many different, beautiful, unique rocks there are in this world that I've spent my entire life walking by, not taking a second to actually look at them. Started with just collecting, then I'd bring them home and wash them, and then eventually I started using a dremel on them and polishing up my favorite ones. It always helped me get outside. Especially after my doggo passed. Now I have far too many rocks, and I enjoy just looking at them or sorting them, kinda dorky but shit, makes me feel again, and feel something good. <br>Good luck to you 😊 I hope things start to feel better soon!</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_lvi6gvr"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/No-Application8200">No-Application8200</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1ggj1ve/looking_for_a_new_hobby_to_help_with_depression/lvi6gvr/">Tue 2024-11-05 at 04:13</a> (1) <a href="#t3_1ggj1ve" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_lvi5ac6" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_lvi6mtd" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_lvi6gvr" class="n S" onclick="setReadHere(t1_lvi6gvr)">◯</a></header><p>I saw knitting in your edit but I honestly think you’d be better off learning crochet.
