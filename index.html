	<p>Hey everyone, I 27M went through a tough break up earlier this year in April. I feel like I’ve done my fair share
		of healing and no longer sitting in grief. But i do feel lonely and that I’m missing on a key aspect of life that
		has always been unobtainable for me. Everyone around me is in relationships, getting married or engaged, and here i
		am with three failed relationships. I’ve went out with 7 women this year and didn’t connect with any of them.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>I feel like I’m running out of time to find the one for me. </p>

			<p>I am old and bitter, but I can very firmly say, do not settle, you will regret it in the quiet moments that
				never get talked about outside your own head. Being single forever isnt a bad thing. Hitting 40 and regreting
				every decision you have made in the last 15 years is far far worse.</p>
			</p>
			<p>
			<p>You make jobs and careers work. Relationships are not a job, you dont "make them work" they do work or they
				dont. Do NOT Settle</p>

				<p>I've done more than one person wrong by believing they had certain traits or qualities that would make a good
					partner, only to realize there wasn't that magic spark that is the indication or desire to spend the rest of
					my life with them. It's a horrible feeling. </p>
				</p>
				<p>
				<p>My last relationship I felt was " one of the ones". 2nd one ever. Before, I did think there could be only
					one. .. but it didn't work out. I agree that I'd rather be alone than settle. At least I know true love can
					strike more than once now.</p>

					<p>Honestly, as best I can tell, luck of the universe. I’m fairly average looks wise, not overweight but not
						shredded. While I am an introvert, when I do interact with people I have pretty good interpersonal skills
						and am situationally funny. I’m kind, respectful, communicative and a good listener. </p>
					</p>
					<p>
					<p>With that out of the way, I’d say 80% of my first dates have been from online, so most of those things
						listed above don’t really help with getting that first date, hence why I said luck. The 20% of dates that
						came from in person interactions were definitely because of the things listed above. My profile is nothing
						special, but objectively good and put together. I’m a hobby photographer so while I don’t have many photos
						of myself, I know how to take good ones, so that does help a bit on the apps. </p>
					</p>
					<p>
					<p>Truly though, I think it comes down to the shitty algorithms were slaves to with online dating. I moved to
						a new city about 3 years ago and in the first 9 months I went on like 45 first dates, all from hinge(the
						only app I’ve ever been successful with). But then I’ve gone through MANY, sometimes long, lulls of
						absolutely nothing, 3+ months. My profile has only gotten better since I moved to where I am, but until a
						couple weeks ago, I’d just gone a number of months with not even a match. So idk if any of this helps but
						it’s insight lol</p>

				<p>A lot of relationships don't get past the 3 month or 6 point for a reason. 3 months is where people usually
					let some of the real them out. 6 months is the power struggle. </p>
				</p>
				<p>
				<p>Even then people change and you change. </p>
				</p>
				<p>
				<p>It's not a race to settle. Enjoy your company. Enjoy life. Also you need to be financially ready for a long

				<p>It's not a failure to not have a partner. It just means you haven't found what you're looking for. Some
					people never find someone and that is still not a failure. It is just life. It is hard to find a healthy

	<p>Listen. I didn't meet mine until 32.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>This is one of those things that if you push and push for, it won't happen. It's almost like people can smell the
		desperation and that's not generally attractive.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>When you relax, get to know yourself and most of all, love yourself for who you are, then it will more than likely
		just happen organically. Don't stress. Chill. Do stuff you like doing, give you time for yourself and just enjoy
		life. That will enable you to make a proper connection with a partner.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>And remember... communication is everything. Feeling comfortable enough to share your thoughts, views, niggles,
		annoyances with your partner will build stronger bonds - if you're receptive to each other's thoughts.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>I credit my relationship being strong to my wife. She wanted to talk about everything - I was, arguably, an
		emotional cripple - she basically had the patience to teach my how to communicate properly. I look back now and
		think, 'Why did I not do this before?'</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>That's the process of growing and learning. Open yourself up a little.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>You're great. Big love.</p>

		<p>This. I met my wife of 18 years when I was 32. I went through so many toxic relationships, and by this I mean I

		</p>
		<p>
		<p>My absolute rule. Be happy with yourself while you are alone. Bring that happiness to the relationship, the

				<p>Find your happiness. Trust me, you will glow when you have it, and no one will say otherwise. Self confidence

			<p>This is rockstar advice. If you’re not Happy with yourself solo , no other person can truly “make” you happy.
				And that’s way too much to place on one person . My goal shifted to find someone who could enhance my current
				happiness that lived inside of my chest when I was sitting solo in my apartment . And who enhanced my peace and
				serenity that I found traveling alone and living alone. Only then did I find my match. My wife enhances
				everything I built alone on my own.</p>

			<p>This so much. The other person doesn't make you. They <em>complement</em> you.</p>

				about marriage but it could be anything. I've repeated the advice to younger people as well, like someone who
				was 15 and truly believed they wanted to marry their significant other. Told the person that if that's the case,
				you can wait until you're 25 because if you're looking to get married, you'll be together when you're 80. They
				broke up a year later.</p>

			<p>It was a process of my wife asking me things and not taking, 'I don't know', or 'I'm not sure' for an answer! I
				was emotionally inscrutable apparently, she never knew what I was thinking. She's a natural communicator, so
				found it very frustrating. Bit by bit, it became a more and more of a habit to be able to describe how I was
				feeling and what I was thinking. I think previously I'd never really known myself either. It took years.</p>

	<p>I met my fiancé at 28 and we got together when I turned 29 and he was 35. He never had a girlfriend before, but
		he's literally the sweetest, most loyal precious man ever. No one ever gave him a chance.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>I went through a hard break up in 2020 after I was with someone for 4 years. It hurt like hell, and I never thought
		I'd ever truly be happy and find "the one". But I did... when I least expected it too! </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>I don't know if you believe in manifesting, but we manifested each other. Years ago, I wrote a list of every single
		quality I wanted in a partner, and he apparently had a dream when he was little he'd marry a girl with his same
		birthday. Well... when we met and he found out we were both born on the same day, he immediately knew I was the
		girl. It floored him. Later I when I revisited my list, he met every single quality I wrote down. It's my favorite
		thing about us.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Mushy stuff aside, I know what it's like to feel hopeless and lonely while everyone else seems to have met their
		person. But you're still young, and a lot of people don't meet their future spouse in their 20's, I think that's a
		silly standard to compare yourself to! I went through horrible, abusive relationships, and never thought I'd get to
		be happy, but I did. And you will too! The universe really works in amazing ways. The right woman will see your
		worth 🤍</p>

					<p>The "bad boy" trope is so overrated and very unrealistic. I love men with soft hearts and who aren't afraid
						to show emotions. My fiancé is very intuitive with my emotions and cries with me. He feels pain when I do.
						He talks about his feelings and communicates and is very sincere and gentle with me. He's tough out in the
						world, sure, but when he comes home, he unravels because he knows I'm his safe place and he can be
						vulnerable with me. </p>
					</p>
					<p>
					<p>He has a very big brain and loves technology and software development. He likes to do puzzles or read
						rather than hunt and fish. And I love that about him!</p>
					</p>
					<p>
					<p>Men who are soft are the best kind. I'm so sorry there's so many standards about what a "real man" should
						be like.</p>

			<p>Of course, but that always back fires and leaves people worse than they started. It’s a relationship based on
				convenience with 2 highly stressed out financially-insecure people.</p>
			</p>
			<p>
			<p>This breeds lack of romanticism and a sex life, as both of you are just surviving. Let alone fights about
				expenses, no dates, chores, work, bills etc. </p>
			</p>
			<p>
			<p>I really advise against the same “settling” for a relationship that isn’t based on love and growth but out of
				necessity and convenience. When one partner leaves or makes a mistakes, it has a huge impact on the other. </p>
			</p>
			<p>
			<p>So many people get evicted for not being able to afford the $2k apartment and the dog, cat, bills, kids etc on
				their own after their person leaves. </p>
			</p>
			<p>
			<p>At least alone I don’t have anyone nagging me that I’m not home enough or why we are having scrambled eggs or
				yogurt for dinner again.</p>

				<p>100% agree that a pure marriage for financial comfort isn't a good idea, just pointing out how badly our
					society is structured to favour a partnership vs going solo. </p>

				<p>
				<p>If that's all a couple have then that's not a very good reason to pair up, but you can't blame people for

	<p>Hey there OP. I know 27 feels old when you’re in your 20s, but you haven’t even hit the prime of your life yet. You
		have decades of life ahead of you. I promise there’s no need to hold onto the anxiety of feeling like you need to
		rush so you can settle down. You will find your person when you aren’t expecting it or looking for it. You’ve got so
		much time. I wish you healing and happiness. But trust me when you’re 37, this relationship and age will feel like a
		lifetime ago. It gets better.</p>

	<p>Your person walks into your life when you’re not seeking them, but chase your own excitement. Let’s say you hear
		about the event that’s super exciting and decide to go or choose to spend a few days at your favorite vacation spot
		just for fun. There’s high likelihood you’ll meet someone there who’s there for the exact same reason and everything
		will just click. It will feel as if universe sent them to you as a reward for Investing in your own fulfillment
		because you deserve it. This is the best way to cross paths with the person who holds the same values as you and is
		not wasting time desperately trying to get matched through friends or dating sites. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>As for time you’re not wasting your time nor does time run out. There are people who rush to force the relationship
		because they felt the time was running out only to witness a disastrous end years later and then they’re back at
		square one. So enjoy this journey and take your time savoring each moment! It will all be worth it.</p>

					<p>Oh my God, friendo. I swear to you - hand on heart - your brain is not fully developed until your mid-20s.
						You literally process the world differently from 21 to 27 to 31. It's been so heavily scientifically
						documented, it's comical. You are not experiencing the "be-all and end-all" right now because your brain
						isn't finished yet.</p>
					</p>
					<p>
					<p>Trust me. Don't assume that things stay the way they are. Also, YOU have the power to seek support, input,
						help, medical care, or company. Just remember that. There are always ways to connect.</p>
					</p>
					<p>
					<p>I felt horrendous at 19, 20, 21, 21, 23...and believe you me, I'm trivalising by saying "horrendous". I'm

				<p>The way some of the mid 20s to 30s go on, a lot genuinely do think they're basically pensioners. But what is
					young is relative, so if you're hanging around a younger crowd you will feel old in comparison perhaps.  </p>

		<p>This, it's only been a couple of months and that's at best good enough to move on from the relationship but not
			enough to focus on oneself and find happiness again. Most attractive people are those that live life to the
			fullest whether or not they're in a relationship. The more focus there is on having SOMEONE the more likely it is
			to be unhealthy and temporary. Easier to find a good partner that you won't be dependent on because you
			automatically repel the bad ones and attract like-minded people for whom a relationship is a great optional
			addition to an already fulfilling life. Nobody should be the one making it fulfilling for someone else </p>

		<p>I love the "only a couple months". That's hilarious. Gotta be alone for way longer to figure yourself out. Be
			independent</p>

		<p>Edit: he's feeling lonely AF when it's only been months. Gotta face the facts that it could be years. Therefore,

	<p>I'm 32 and felt this way plenty. I've had 3 LTRs and 2 of them broke my heart, while i broke the heart of my first.
		The last one really took me out for awhile, I was single for 3 years after that. I felt like I was unlovable and
		just wouldn't ever find lasting love. So I get it, but really the key is to just find a way to love yourself. Its
		cliche but believe me, focus on yourself. I only recently, in June, met someone and we really clicked. Im still
		focused on myself and even if this relationship doesn't work, I won't be destroyed. And think that's the key. We're
		only on this planet for a small amount of time and ultimately you have control of your own life. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Don't give up on love. Its a beautiful thing, but let it come on its own accord and don't force it.</p>

	<p>What is meant to be will not go past you.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Reciprocal love is the dream. Some people search for it all their lives and never find it. Others confuse being in
		love with the first flush of romance and never truly understand the deeper peace and connection that comes from
		truly loving someone else.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>You cannot force it. Love is the natural by-product of a thousand conversations, hundred dates, and a million
		glances in each other's eyes. Whoever you date, forget about the love, that takes care of itself over time, as long
		as you're willing to love them. Just male the date fun. You don't have to be smooth or sophisticated, just make her
		laugh.</p>

	<p>hi OP, i’m also from Toronto. dating here is really fucking brutal, and i’m in the same boat. it’s hard to deal
		with that sinking feeling of “what if i never find someone”. the more you look at others in relationships and
		compare the more it’ll feel like you’re the odd one out. but ive grown to understand that its not odd to be single
		in your 20s whatsoever, and that in fact there’s millions of others in the exact same position, feeling the exact
		same way. instead of comparing to my friends in relationships, i’ve started to flip my mindset a bit and find solace
		in relating to the few single friends that i have, or in posts like your own that show we really are all out here
		struggling with finding someone and there isn’t anything wrong with us for that. lately ive been trying to place
		less of a focus on it, because the more i do that the more miserable it makes me. i’m not able to enjoy other
		aspects of my life when my mind is constantly wishing i had a partner. spending time with friends helps to a certain
		extent, as well as doing all the things that id want to do with a partner, by myself instead. but i know that there
		is no true replacement to romantic love, and that’s okay. it’s more about becoming tolerant of the discomfort you
		feel rather than allowing it to consume you. until one day you find your person :)</p>

	<p>A man has till 40 to get a decent partner, after that it’s divorcees. After 30 most women will be kinda pushy, and
		most likely might be a little ran over (relax), but by that point men are too. The most important thing to remember
		is not judging someone for something that you are too. After 40 it might get real messy. Consider not meeting people
		on the internet and tuning into your reality the way people use to be. Like who are the women around you that fate
		has brought into your life.</p>

	<p>You're still young. Work on yourself. I know this is probably spat out by a lot of people but it's true </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>I understand the feeling very well. I was in an abusive relationship yet still loved the person and he died about 6
		months ago leaving me with 2 young children to raise. I'm youngish so there are times where it feels like I'll be
		alone forever then there are times where I feel guilty for wanting another relationship. Then there are times where
		I wonder if I even know how tp be in a relationship and think I'm better off being alone. It's a lot but working on
		yourself is the foundation so when those things do come to you and you build the metaphoric house, it doesn't all
		collapse in on you like mine did. You've got to have aa solid foundation and the only way it will ever be solid is
		when you realize you can have happiness on your own too.</p>

			<p>Completely ignore the boomers and people yapping here. They cant fathom the current reality for people our age
				in the west because they grew up in the 80's on the last of the golden ages crust or they're priviledged to live
				in a decent pocket that makes them short sighted.</p>
			</p>
			<p>
			<p>I live in a very similar place but I would have to say the psychology is worse where you live with the social
				mythology there, had a long break from the dating scene until my fiancee from india passed.</p>
			</p>
			<p>
			<p>I went on 83 dates the year after that, I have a good business, the style, the looks, the personality and they
				all ghosted me or attempted to use me. Women are absolutely delusional with their tastes, its not just them
				either, its the men too who have it easy by chance that validate bad behavior.</p>
			</p>
			<p>
			<p>Entertainment has been etched so far into peoples mentality their expectations are not with reality. I was
				lucky I had the ability to condition myself into asexuality.</p>
			</p>
			<p>
			<p>The only choice is to psychologically evaluate the average of the people around you and determine if you can
				move to a better place if you cannot adapt. </p>
			</p>
			<p>
			<p>There is a pandemic of mental illness here in the west that is hard to recognize with alot of it so normalized.
				Its hard but there is nothing else we can do.</p>

	<p>It will take some time to really move on and be comfortable being alone again, but it will happen. What you

				<p>As someone who’s introverted and lives in a heavily religious area (of which I am not apart of said religion)
					I’m not looking for dates from those types of places and being introverted really doesn’t help. It’s something
					I’ve come to terms with and am of the easy going mindset that if it’s meant to be, it’ll happen in a way that
					makes sense. If that’s tomorrow great, if it’s in 5 years great. Until then, I’ll keep working on building

					<p>I agree with most of what you said except expecting that it will happen.</p>
					</p>
					<p>
					<p>Sure women will approach you if you have a career, become successful and mature emotionally. But you should
						also try to balance it out with approaching women you really want to meet and know more about (And that's an
						entire art). </p>
					</p>
					<p>
					<p>My 3 best friends are all women. Only 1 of them approached me due to my personality the other 2 i actively
						approached them because i found them cute but also extremely interesting. Nothing blossom into anything
						romantic mainly due to what i want but they are the reason i can have some of the best evenings or weekends
						nowadays.</p>

		everyone wants to be loved, no one on this planet is owed a relationship. No one is entitled to a girlfriend or
		boyfriend. Just focus on you and making yourself happy when you are single. You would be happier in the long run. If
		you find someone then that’s great but if you don’t, you’ll still be happy by yourself</p>

	<p>Not to be nihilistic, man, but it doesn't get any easier with age. Im fixing to turn 39, had a string of terrible
		relationships, all of whom I thought was "the One". It was a very hard lesson to learn but after my last
		relationship, I started learning to make peace with the idea that I'm probably never going to find them and that I'm

	<p>READHERE I don't think there's such a thing as 'my person'. I used to think so until 'my person' decided to cheat
		on me.
		Multiple times.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>You'll never meet 'the perfect person', what movies and fantasy doesn't tell you is that love is a choice. You
		choose a person, their bad habits, their flaws, their worst bits... and choose to stay with them because whatever
		they add to your life is worth it.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>How long did you date each girl? One date is hardly enough to get to know people. First conversations are always
		awkward, and people need some time to get used to the other person yadda yadda.</p>

	<p>It might not seem like it now, but you're still young. You just happen to be in a friend group where everyone is
		doing things on the earlier side. Out of my friends, only 1 was married by 27 and many hadn't met their future
		spouses yet, or were in the early days with them. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Also, this is just my opinion, but I don't believe in a love at first sight thing. Maybe it happens, but I'd say
		it's far from the norm. If you go on a date with someone and have a good time, but don't feel an immediate
		"connection" or "spark" that doesn't mean they're not a fit for you. If they're interested, give it a second or
		third date before you decide.</p>

		thing is I went through hell to find him. I had pretty much gotten used to just being the girlfriend til the guy
		moved on. I don’t think I’ve ever been anyone’s first choice. His family also love me that’s actually genuine and I
		actually love them back. Sometimes it truly takes time.</p>

	<p>The harder you try, the more desperate you seem--and, probably, are. Go out in the world, have fun, develop/pursue
		your hobbies. Nothing attracts like confidence. Go do things that give you joy, satisfaction, build empathy.
		Interesting, confident people attract others. Don't waste time measuring yourself against others. That's just a form
		of self-flagellation. Go do good, have fun. The right person will show up. And then, you'll have good stories to
		share!</p>

		and putting in effort until you meet someone you really get along with and respect. Also remember that it’s not

	<p>At this stage focus on being the best person you can be and give as much love out to the world as you can. You'll

		It’s fine to actively look for a relationship, but it should be second to taking care of yourself. Make yourself

	<p>
	<p>You do not realise how good things are going to get.... in a very very short time.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>The very best years for a single man are your 30's. You finally have maturity (good women love that), you probably
		have assets (proves to women you are a wise partner), Have a STABLE career sorted, still have your looks and health.
	</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Women who want "excitement" and to "party" may not look a that (but they are unrealistic because life never stays
		exciting 24/7) but women who deep down seek a long term partner find the above list very very attractive.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Dont worry about age 27, just get your career sorted and save up for the deposit on a house of your own. Travel a
		bit to foreign countries, if you can, to make you a wiser and more broad minded man too. Travel makes you grow as a
		person!</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>I became single again at age 36 and I shit you not, there is no shortage of great women seeking men in their 30's.
		In fact you will get a LOT of women as young as 20 or 19 seeking you out when you are in your 30's!!!</p>

	<p>I've never loved someone more than my first girlfriend. But that was cringy, abusive, shame and joy all both ways.
		I bet we are different persons now, like, unknowns.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>So many relationships later, I settle with a regular and kind woman. She is not "amazing", she's not like me, she's
		not like a dream come true. She's hot thou.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>We both wanted to form a family. We still get to know something new about eachother from time to time. We dont took
		ourselves for granted.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>As someone said, its not about who but when, you are ready to get married.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>The thing we have built with my wife is still a work in progress. But its unique and I now I wouldn't change it for
		anything in the world. You can call it love, but wasn't something already there. We worked it and build it.</p>

	<p>Similar situation, honestly contrary to how you feel I am excited to be by myself. It means I have time to grow,
		explore my dreams without requiring to give space for someone else. Improve my sense of self and change things about
		me that I don't like or that I see as being something I used to need in life but don't have the use for anymore.
	</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>I can advance my career options, pursue jobs I don't want to take when I have a partner. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>It might be challenging now but I believe your outlook is very pessimistic and change can feel difficult or many
		other areas of life can feel challenging if you were expecting something to happen in a relationship. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>I just believe it is better to start thinking about yourself There's a lot that can happen in 1 to 5 years. Put
		yourself where you want to end up and generally things will end up coming to you in a way you aren't prepared for.
		Working on yourself is important for being a better partner too!</p>

	<p>It's a legit feeling!! I wish people would stop trying to invalidate your comment because it doesn't seem logical
		to them. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>I'm 28 , and I can't tell you how many times I've had that thought. <br>Also as someone whose mom was married and
		had her 1st child at 21 and 2nd by 23. I always wanted to get married and have kids early... definitely by at least
		25... so it's understanding when things turn out different than you'd imagine. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>When I usually start to feel like that , it's because I'm peeking at other people's lives. I have to take a step
		back and look at how I'm living my life. Also, I remind myself that everyone timeline on life looks different. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Then, I plan things that I, as an individual, want to accomplish and achieve and focus on that. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>I also have a real conversation with myself about what if I was meant to be single... is that the end of the world
		... No. What are the pros of being single ? <br /><br>And I try and take away the fear of the unknown part of that .
	</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Lastly, I make a point to focus on the person I currently am and see how I can improve that person for my future
		person. And what kind of person am I projecting out into the world ? </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Also, start becoming okay with the fact that life is not working on your timeline but has one of its own. Because
		it's only your timeline that's making you disappointed. You may be right on time and am supposed to meet your person
		at 28 or 30 ... who knows ? </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>I also suggest Journaling. Expressing that is always good but also in future years looking back on life and how you
		thought and acted is good for reflection. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Also writing a future letter to the future you, future spouse, future kids (if you want them ,) etc. Is something
		really cool and sweet.</p>

	<p>27M here, with three failed relationships, recently single too. I understand your pain and your fear and your
		loneliness. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>We will be okay. We have loved, and will love again. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Keep your head up and keep meeting people! But keep working on yourself in the meantime. Be the best version of
		yourself, for you, with the added benefit that whoever is lucky enough to be with you next will also get the best
		version of you. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Stay strong. You’ll be happy again, and happy for a long time, soon.</p>

	<p>I'm 31F also with 3 failed relationships. I just broke up with my last one due to different visions of what our
		futures would look like, but we still have a good friendship.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Don't worry too much about it. Enjoy your 20s because you'll never be able to get that. Stop comparing yourself
		with others. Instead, focus on how you can self-develop. If you get into a relationship without fully knowing
		yourself, it wouldn't be a pretty one. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>A lot of people force themselves into a marriage because they're afraid of still being alone in their 30s. As a
		result, they don't have a happy relationship and wound up divorced. Hence, focus on yourself in the meantime, what
		you enjoy in life, and spending time with your loved ones.</p>

		25-year marriage and and let me tell you man or woman it was bullshit I did what I was supposed to do it's all nice
		I didn't deedle nobody's doodle I wasn't jumpy I wasn't pissy happy every morning good with kids raised them. I
		asked when I went through college I had three of them in diapers four total paid off my house sold it bought another
		house for the most part everybody's happy not a whole lot of wants you know had to eat borrow one hot dogs every
		once in awhile but you know everybody does and then all of the sudden my wife develops an odd addiction for strange
		ding dongs so yeah you get a hold somebody you want to take your time anyways. Now all the kids are gone I'm home
		alone dingbat somewhere hanging off of chandeliers if I could have seen the future I don't think I'd have been so

	<p>Ignore what everyone else is doing. Focus on you and learning to enjoy single life. It's fine to want someone else,
		but ideally, you don't want to feel like you need someone else so you can be happy. You should really only feel like

		<p>I really dislike when people tell me to love myself and to enjoy being single and lonely…. It’s usually the ones
			who are in happy and in meaningful relationships that say that, and it’s usually individuals who don’t know what
			it means to truly go from being in a relationship to one day not being in one. There is nothing enjoyable about
			waking up to yourself when you are used to waking up to the feeling of love and a meaningful existence because of
			that relationship. There is nothing meaningful about loneliness, unless you don’t like to share, and your
			character is that of selfishness. <br>I also can’t stand when people say if you want a companion, get a dog or a
			cat? Usually all those individuals that say that are also in meaningful relationships where they enjoy picking up
			dog or cat shit every two or so hours and enjoy spending all there hard earned money at the vet when the animal
			gets sick. Those people irk me because they’d rather spend time with a soulless animal than to form meaningful
			relationships with a person whose has feelings and emotions. A bunch of insensitive trolls on here. Im downvoting
			all the downvotes!</p>

			<p>I'm not one of those people. I was married for ten years before finding out my wife was cheating. Then she left
				me with the kids on my birthday without a word. I spent years feeling lonely and suffering from deep depression.
				I understand how it feels, I really do. </p>
			</p>
			<p>
			<p>I also understand that my advice isn't what you wanted to hear because it doesn't help you feel better now. The
				thing is, nothing on life worth having comes easy, friend. </p>
			</p>
			<p>
			<p>It's hard, and the way you feel is going to probably get worse before it gets better. Even though it doesn't
				feel like it now, it will get better. </p>

	<p>I was in a similar place once when I was 32 years old. Had the worst breakup of my life. Thought she was the one

	<p>Whoa this is so weird! My ex and I broke up in April too! But I totally feel where you’re coming from. We were

	<p>Something that took me a while to do, but I suggest you do. Take some time to reflect on your failed relationships.
		Answer honestly: Why did they fail? What was your part in the failure? What could you have done that would've been
		better?<br>Learn somethimg from each relationship. What was good? What was bad? Being honest with yourself about it
		may help you in the next one. And like others have said, it'll happen when it's meant to. Don't rush it. You can go
		through LONG "dry spells". But don't shy away. Get out and enjoy yourself and be social. Take care of yourself
		(physically memtally, emotionally, spiritually) and love yourself.</p>

	<p>At age 29, I broke up with my then gf of nearly 6 years. Someone that I saw as my forever person for the first 4
		years, but went through a really tough final 2 years before I thought we could both use a clean break from each
		other. It was scary to do it, but after some time to think it over, I started to really enjoy just being comfortable
		with myself.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>I went through several first and second dates over the next few years. Then I found a really good connection at age
		34. 10+ years later, we're coming up on our 8th anniversary.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Long story short... 27 years old is really young. Have you even had time to find and work on yourself?</p>

	<p>Don't worry my brother. Having this fear is normal, but unnecessary. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>I myself am 33, and in the same situation. Was married until 30, then divorced. Then met and dated my ex for 2
		years, and after 3 months of living together found out some red flags that made me realize a break up was the only
		option. Part of me knows I probably saw these earlier on, but I wanted/needed it to work because I also felt like I
		was running out of time, and didn't want to start from scratch. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>It's my boss at work that made me realize I was wrong. He was married, divorced at 33, and then was alone for 2
		years. Then he met his wife, and had his first kid at 37. He's 50 now, has a 13 year old son and an 11 year old
		daughter, and he and his wife just make it work. He's very realistic and doesn't believe in "The One", and he
		probably also at one point he was too old to have a family. He didn't plan on meeting his wife, it just happened.
	</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>So yeah, dating can suck, especially with this whole online culture. But one day you might just run into your One,
		and she will be totally worth the wait. So don't worry, and try to enjoy this period of your life as well.</p>

	<p>It’s always a tough time after a break up, feeling like maybe there’s no one compatible out there. There is though.
		There are probably many people. Just a matter of being patient until you find a “the one”. My previous relationship

		my previous partner haha. You never know how good it can be til it arrives! Keep your chin up bud.</p>

	<p>I was in a failed relationship from 25-29, wound up imploding upon breakup and nearly ruining my life for a couple
		years. I didn’t meet my wife until I was 35. We’ve now been together for 15 years, happily married for 13 and have a
		12 year old kid. You have time. Loads of time. In fact, there is no timeline. Stop putting pressure on yourself.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Frankly, I’m pretty happy the relationship from my 20s fell apart as I met someone way better later.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>And hey, odds are that at least one or two of those friends of yours who are getting married now will be divorced
		in a few years and starting right back where you are now. You actually have a head start and no alimony.</p>

	<p>I’m 26m and was outright holding out on one specific girl for probably the last 4 years now. I got a date coming up
		with someone else that I’ve been really excited for. However this morning I woke up spontaneously extremely
		depressed. I realized that I simply couldn’t date just anybody but it just HAD to be the girl I’ve been holding out
		for years over. So I messaged her earlier today…</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>She told me she liked me to, but to my surprise she’s been dating someone for around a year now and are probably
		going to move in together very soon. She told me that all I could’ve done was ask sooner, but now it can’t happen.
		That hit me really really hard just a couple hours ago.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>I guess I thought that door would be open forever somehow. I didn’t know it closed a while ago….</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>My night has not been good honestly, in fact it’s probably been the lowest I’ve felt in maybe my entire life.
		However, there’s a poem that has got me through a lot of my life, and I’m leaning heavy on it literally right this
		second. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>&gt;Let everything happen to you: beauty and terror. / Just keep going. No feeling is final</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>This is really tough for you right now, and if we can be kindred spirits for a second, it’s really fucking tough on
		me too at the moment. You just have to remember how big your life is and will be. I can’t really see the light at
		the end of the tunnel right now, but I know it’s coming up at some point. I wish that for you to.</p>

	<p>It might not feel this way but you are YOUNG, instead of looking so hard for your partner look for YOU. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Find some hobbies that make you interact with others, join a 4X4 club, archery, hiking, take some classes at the
		community center. Something that makes your heart beat faster when you do it, one day you'll look up and find a
		woman who makes your heart beat faster and she will think you're exciting and interesting because she met you while
		you were both talking an extreme scuba diving class or your hands touched while you were both reaching for the cut
		off tool at pottery class ❤️</p>

	<p>Learn to be happy alone and you will be able to much better define who you wanna spend your life with.</p>

	<p>
	<p>When you get to a point where a partner can only add to your life and not just fill a hole in it, you won't be
		grabbing at every opertunity and finding someone genuine will be a thousand times easier.</p>

	<p>you’re still so young, and there are so many people you haven’t even met yet who will come into your life. you
		might want to try stepping away from dates for awhile and use the time to focus on yourself. it’s not about rushing
		to find the "one" but about enjoying the journey and discovering who you are in the process and that will also help
		you understand what you truly want and need. so focus on building a life that fulfills you, and the right connection
		will eventually find its way to you.</p>

	<p>I met my now boyfriend a week after my 40th birthday and we’re celebrating 2.5 years together today. I never ever
		thought I’d find him and it look a lot of work on myself personally. But here’s my story:</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>TLDR background: very unkind bossy older sister and being chubby as a child left me as an adolescent with dreadful
		self esteem and an eating disorder. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>My dating history was genuinely embarrassing - I put up with so much behaviour that I shouldn’t have because of how
		I felt about myself. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>At 26 I got together with a guy I thought was “a bit” of a bad boy. Turns out he was literally a local gangster
		with an awful criminal history (that the police told him he had to declare to me. He didn’t, told them he did, and
		they believed him. Thanks police!) we had a baby togther just before I was 30 and post natal depression hit me hard.
		It was like the moment of birth all the realisation of who he really was, how our relationship really was just hit
		me. He was hardly ever home and would come home at like 4am drunk or high. He became more and more controlling and
		erratic and I realised he had a very serious class A drug habit. I had to get restraining orders etc. he ended up
		causing a very nasty fatal accident and went to prison. He was then deported to his home country. That’s the way I
		got away from him. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>After that I promised myself not to ever ever be treated like that again. But guess what ? My self esteem was still
		rock bottom and I entered another relationship with a guy who basically needed a mum / social worker not a
		girlfriend. 5 years of on off on off, drugs, gambling, stealing from me. He was so unkind to me and belittled me
		about my weight constantly.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>6 months before I turned 40 I had this moment of complete clarity of “I can’t go into my 40s like this” my late 20s
		and entire 30s had been donated to men with serious issues who I tried to help/rehabilitate etc due to my own issues
		about how I felt about myself. So I booked weight loss surgery. This is the absolute key thing that has helped my
		life change. Losing the weight and not having such an intense self hatred has been life changing. The absence of
		that hatred has helped me to leave this idiot once and for all, retrain in a new job and to download tinder. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>I thought long and hard about tinder 🔥 about who I would match with and who I wouldn’t and I had a list of
		“immediately no” criteria (shirtless photos, photos sticking his tongue out and a few more) and I just did that
		knowing I didn’t owe anyone my time or energy. If there was a “red flag” in the photos or profile, gone. If
		something he said gave me the ick, unmatched, if I didn’t answer quick enough and he followed up with “???” Gone.
		Sounds a bit arrogant or selective but that’s the entire point. I was looking for someone who I really clicked with.
		I was chatting to two guys and after a couple of weeks I arranged to meet them for a coffee. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Date 1) the guy was nice but even by text I thought I was enjoying chatting to the other guy more. We met for a
		coffee, he was a really good guy, but I just didn’t feel “it”</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Date 2) wow within about 10 mins I just thought “this is him”. I was comfortable, relaxed, the conversation flowed
		easily. When I had to go for the school pick up time I texted my two best friends “I’m going to marry him”. And here
		we are 2.5 years later absolutely perfect for each other. We just match so well, I love him so much. I never ever
		thought I would find him. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>BIG and AMAZING changes can happen. I would say the #1 factor for me was to improve my self esteem. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>If I had to go through everything again to meet him at 40, I would ❤️</p>

	<p>My story: I was head-over-heels in love with "Jim", but Jim rejected my suggestion of moving in with him, saying
		that it wouldn't work. I was crushed! I went home, cried, cried some more. For about 4 months I found myself
		inspecting every guy I knew: "Would he be the one? How about him?" I felt desperate to find The One. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>And then one day I just stopped. I looked at my life: I had great friends, a good house, a fantastic job, a fun
		hobby, cats (of course). I could travel when and where I liked. It suddenly hit me that I didn't <em>need</em>
		someone to make me happy. I was making <em>myself</em> happy. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Three months later I met my now-husband. It was as if I had to realize that I was in charge of my own life before I
		could add someone to it. Oh, and I was 35 at the time. You are young and have plenty of time to find your own
		happiness.</p>

	<p>Going through same thing. I have given up on dating and think if it's meant to happen, it's meant to happen. I do
		want to be married and have kids but at the same time I feel at peace for the first time not trying to constantly
		meet people. Letting things be organic for the first time after 5 years of dating the wrong people. Honestly trying
		to find happiness in my life without depending on a person.</p>

	<p>I used to feel a lot like you until I was like 30. Chill out, 27 is quite young. You are not missing out, but
		probably just saving yourself from your first divorce. I can assure you a lot of those people getting engaged will
		be divorce or separated in a few years. It happens. It's normal.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Second, probably you are trying too hard to find connection and a relationship and that reeks.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>This may not work with everyone, but it did with me, but as far as you are straight and honest about it with the
		other person, learn to just enjoy a few one night stands or situationships (FWB) without focus on looking for a
		relationship but in just having fun. That way you will not be feeling everytime you go on a date like you lost your
		time.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Also agreed with other comments, the "my person thing is BS". The are millions of people compatible with you and
		other millions not compatible with you, but the romantic "my person" is super damaging on expectations. <br /><br>An
		example would be the protagonist of (500) days of summer.</p>

	<p>Stop looking for romance, it sadly doesnt really exist any more.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Lots of people here saying "i found my ..... when i was 40+" etc. The problem is that the world has chamged for us
		that are younger than 40. We dont socialise the same way, people use apps for dating not meeting people in real life
		situations. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Even if you dont play the modern dating games, people will take that as a new meta play in the modern dating games.
	</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Find friends and companionship with absolutly no effort or interest put twards romantic intentions, it will
		transform your life. That thing you feel missing isnt romance, its acceptance and understanding from another human,
		and that connection does not need to be either romantic or exclusive. Build your comunity and together you can all
		suport each other and share wonderful experiences.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>And if you really do find that romance is missing from your life, well its alot easier to find one of the few
		people who arnt in the vicious cycle of the dating app wasteland of you have a group of plutonic friends who know
		and trust you as a good person.</p>

	<p>I'm 28F and in the same boat, broke up with my partner of nearly 10 years in March after I found out he cheated on
		me. I always worry I will never find anyone I truly love, connect with and can be my complete self around like I
		could with my ex. Right now it feels like no one else could ever live up to him. But this is normal to feel like
		this after a breakup and what I have to remind myself, which I will remind you: </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>A. You are still young and you have plenty of time </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>B. You've only been single for less than a year.  </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>C. You won't fully connect with most people. You would be one of the lucky ones if you found a good match in 7
		dates, so don't see it as a failure that none of them worked out.  </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>D.  There is no such thing as the "one", there is a certain portion of the population who you could potentially be
		a "one" with rather than a single individual.  </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>E. Don't look at past relationships as failures. Most relationships don't work out and we learn more about
		ourselves and what we want through those past relationships  </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>One day you will probably look back and chuckle at yourself for ever feeling this way. I totally get it, it comes
		from a fearful place and not a rational one. Best of luck!</p>

	<p>Recommend that you make a list of what you think you want in a partner and see if that list really can be fulfilled
		by someone. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Sometimes we imagine how our so called other half supposed to be. But perhaps in really our expectations are off.
	</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Remember men and women really are not the same. We think and look at the world differently. This includes what we
		look for in a partner. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>You can start from there, you can say I know from experience. Especially since I had bunch of failed relationships.
	</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>One thing for sure, don’t be so hard on yourself and honestly I don’t believe we have the “one” out there. Just
		enjoy life.</p>

	<p>FWIW I got divorced at 25. I lost 120 lb or so in a year and got super fit. By 27 I was living the best bachelor
		life I can imagine. I never thought I would be married and never thought I would be a dad and I was really okay with
		that. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>About 3 months before I turned 29 I went out with a girl I met in junior high when I was in 7th grade and was dared
		to ask an eighth grader to dance. It was not a date. Neither one of us had romantic intentions - we had stayed
		friends through high school and run into each other a few times over the years but we were just going to hang out
		and we both had plans later on that evening. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>We ended up not telling each other till later but we both canceled plans under the bar using T9 texting which of
		you're 28 you probably have no idea what that is but if you ever saw one of us writing a whole text message with
		just the number pad you would probably accuse us of witchcraft. It's not impressive it's just what we had to do. I
		digress...</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Now at 45 years old, she's 46 and will be 47 before I'm 46 and I like to remind her of that frequently and somehow
		we are still married. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Oh yeah I went from thinking I was going to have an absolutely amazing single life at 28 to married by 30 and the
		father of a newborn by 31. Now at 45 I have an 11 year old and a 13 year old and I'm making nice with my wife
		because we got pissy at each other this morning because of a miscommunication and also we were both late diagnosed
		ADHD but you probably already figured that out by now. Yeah we met each other as children and leaned on each other
		our entire lives before we got married.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Anyway I think my point is, you have no idea what could happen in the next few years. It's positively incredible
		how your person will just show up in your life and then all of a sudden you're worried about things like getting the
		sprinklers blown out and closing the pool. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>You're doing fine, just keep being yourself and living your life and going on those dates because you learn more
		than you think you do when you go on those dates.</p>

	<p>Maybe because your goals are set on the wrong aspect right now. Have you asked yourself why do you feel you need
		someone? Until you're not comfortable in your own skin, being alone, with your thoughts, your behavior, your habits,
		then you will fill the need to be in constant companionship because you don't want to face yourself. Life is not a
		race to find your significant other. Even though finding your ideal partner is a beautiful aspiration and a worthy
		cause, there is so much more to life than marriage, kids, etc. (as you listed this in your goals). Work on yourself,
		on being at peace in your own skin, and the rest will come naturally.</p>

	<p>The best way to get into a bad relationship is to be desperate to find your person.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>I found my first love at 27 but unfortunately ignored many things that didn't work between us. After a very brutal
		number of years trying to make it work, we went our separate ways. I decided I didn't need anyone at that point but
		stumbled into a relationship with most amazing person at age 37.</p>

	<p>I was starting to feel the same way at 28 and it had been a few years since I had a serious relationship. Then I
		happened to meet the love of my life when I was 32 and we just moved in together and I'm proposing next fall. If we
		had met when we were younger, I'm not certain we would've hit it off. We met at the perfect time for each other and
		where we are in life. Just have to work on yourself and you'll run into the right person!</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Edit: by work on yourself, I mean make sure you're in a good place to be a good and supportive partner to someone

	<p>I'm 45m just got divorced and have a similar fear but that's been alleviated in the past year by the freedom I'm
		being afforded and the thought that the future is wide open relative to dating.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>I was in your shoes at 27. Found my wife, credited her with saving me from the pit of lonely despair. But
		unfortunately that left me open to a thoughtless woman whom I did everything to keep happy. She was never happy. I
		was never happy.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>She was the wrong woman.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Her mother stole from us at our wedding reception.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>She ended the marriage by spending $120k without my buy in on various home improvements.<br>She thought I wouldn't
		leave because of the 3 children we shared.<br>She thought I wouldn't leave because I always came back.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Leave when they don't hold up their end of the deal.<br>Leave when they obviously don't care about you.</p>
	</p>
	<p>

	<p>Hey, in case this helps, you're not the only person going through the same. It almost sounds like you're telling my
		story, but my breakup was in February and I'm 33M. If there is one thing that I can tell is that it gets better with
		time. The best thing you can do is to focus on yourself, try to remove the pressure of finding someone (It's not
		easy, it comes and goes for me), but try to find out what patterns your last relationships had in common. We at
		times look and crave for a certain type of person, that is familiar to what we subconsciously know (usually relation
		to your childhood), but at times this type of person is not the right one for us. This just makes us look for the
		same type of person, and we don't feel comfortable or feel disconnected if it's not what we're used to. We do this
		unconsciously. I highly recommend reflecting on it and to break the pattern. If you have time, I suggest reading
		about childhood trauma (It sounded ridiculous for me too, I had a perfectly normal childhood.. but I could identify
		certain patterns from that in me). It certainly gets better as things start making more sense of why they're
		happening and it takes off some of the pressure you feel. I currently take my dates with humor and a learning
		opportunity, no matter if it goes well or not, and I have to say that I feel more and more connected. So don't lose
		your hopes, it's a matter of time, just stay present in the moment (don't look at the past, nor plan what is
		expected in the future). Good luck!</p>

	<p>Also to remember you have a life outside of someone. You need to identify and also understand how to be comfortable
		with yourself to so that you don’t rush into anything. You can say you healed and much more but also rushing into
		things makes things even worst. Take your time don’t let outside things break who u are and rush your time.</p>

	<p>I was like that, though for me it's because I kept getting rejected.  Just focus on the things that make you happy

	<p>There is definitely a person out there that you vibe more with, someone you feel like is like a soulmate. I found
		mine! </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>But I think the norm is to find someone that you match fairly well with, you will find some disagreements on things
		and learn from each other, and if you are lucky — they stay with you and you want to stay with them. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>But never settle. Don’t do that to yourself. Where you think this is fine but secretly you’re wondering if the
		grass is greener on the other side. But also know when you’re asking a bit too much (ie it’s not what you want but
		what society tells you that you want)</p>

	<p>As others have said, there is not a “one for you”. People are made to connect. So get out there and connect. The
		key isn’t to find the perfect person it is to find the person you can accept and can accept you. Just don’t get in
		this idea that you can change them or they can change you. That isn’t going to happen. So just relax, and make some

	<p>You will have many people in your life, as long as you are open to possibilities and willing to put in your share

	<p>There is not just one person who is magically perfect and that's it. Even if a match seems like it is, there will

	<p>
	<p>A lot of the people in my circles who we all thought had it figured out early are now divorced, or miserable,

	<p>I worry about this a lot too...I'm M44 and although I go on a steady stream of dates every now and then...I feel
		like either its not a match or its a match but then she will get bored fast because there's too many other men
		pursuing her (women by default have way more options than men, and keep their options open).....Lots of times I feel
		that just by default if I'm interested, the woman needs to pull away because there is no chase or game and simply on
		principle since I must be low value if I'm trying to move things forward and see her again... (I give personal space
		and don't blow up the phones or "over-text" to demonstrate I have other things going on and a life) It makes me come
		to the conclusion that without any reference points of high value such as social proof and preselection...unless the
		woman is just fully on board with you as you are, there is no hope.</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>I feel I'm always in a loop and it never ends, I'm very relaxed but I replay passed dates and wonder what I did
		wrong or was it something completely out of my control.... I can't help but think I'm doing micro-transgressions
		like my eyes show too much I find her attractive, I possibly up-talked in our conversation (sign of weakness
		subconsciously for women) maybe my face is weird because I'm not symmetrical, I know I dress well and groom well so
		its not that, my body language has to be 100% on point so maybe my shoulders slouched at one point or I was being
		very expressive (feminine traits, that aren't attractive/polarizing enough to attract a woman) I'm always working on
		myself but at the same time trying to keep all my neuroticisms about this hidden</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>The best way to describe how I feel is like being on the high-rise tight rope in the circus - now envision this:
		You are about to go on the tight rope with a unicycle, you are also juggling pins and you need to balance yourself,
		there is no room for the slightest error because you will fall into the netting all the way at the bottom. If you do
		so there is no retrying because the show must go on so its just you fail and the crowd kind of feels bad for
		you...but its not enough....so even if you are pulling it off then its like "ok pretty impressive, now can you do
		that whole thing again while going through the fiery hoops too?" So its like damn can I ever be enough? All I see is
		that I need to be 120% perfect around a woman otherwise I can hear her mind going - NEXT! </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Best of all, I don't blame women at all because they have been conditioned and made to be this tough through a
		millennia of sexual selection its simply nature...they are in control and you have to deal with the woman in front
		of you and you have to also be mindful of her subconscious &amp; unconscious mind...their radars or scrambled
		because if you are nice that means you are weak, if you open up and allow yourself to be vulnerable you are
		weak....so often times good behaviors are bad and bad behaviors are good because they need the right balance of
		polarity and it is a delicate balance. They need to feel you are strong inside and out....in todays society, it
		isn't easy for men to demonstrate this because we'll probably get arrested...The only solution I see is either pure
		luck - the girl just likes you and is fully onboard with you or you have a life situation that you easily
		demonstrate how you have social proof and preselection, a life she wants to be a part of. This is like cocaine for
		women...</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>I don't know what more to do, I keep working to improve myself, I have a fitness trainer, I stay active, I go out
		to try to meet people. I'm afraid I'll die alone and I would love to have a family of my own...it makes me so upset
		when I see people sick, handicapped, children dying of cancer ...I'm like tell me how this is fair? All I see is
		well its Mother Nature - emphasis on Mother - the female energy - chaos energy that can be so beautiful and alive
		yet so cruel and evil with no remorse...perhaps in our folklore and things we say that come from a lost time have
		deeper significance in their meaning....I just wonder why can't I get the cancer and give the chance to the poor kid
		that has a future...I see my parents getting older and I have this deep fear of losing them....then I'll be truly
		alone, I often hope to go before them but then I feel bad for my parents having to deal with that....I don't know
		but I try to stay positive in little hope I see from time to time</p>

	<p>There is no such person. You need to learn live with yourself first, do sports, organise your health and
		financials, make sure you won’t end up homeless, make yourself centre of your world and then and only then you’ll
		stop project neediness and dependency which women detect and hate. Before entering into ANY relationships you
		absolutely have to make sure you understand legal obligations (consult with family lawyers), make sure you won’t die
		in case of divorce. Learn intergender dynamics, find SSM channel on YouTube, become independent and self-sufficient
		and the and only then you’ll stop project may start thinking about any kind of relationship apart of “paid love”.

			<p>Not sure who I insult. Emotional, physical, economical dependence of one person from another is a bad thing. I
				see double standards when people say to females “you go girl, be independent” and at the same time when someone
				teaches men to be strong and independent, that person feels insulted. Loneliness is not something I promote. I
				encourage men to be ok on themselves, not to seek emotional support especially from women, to be stoic and
				strong. Why do you need weak, emotional men that seeking validation from women? That kind of men are easily
				manipulated and exploited. Men must be strong. Which means independent from someone’s judgement and validation.

				<p>Ok sure… we have no choice… but to be told to be happy, in a state of loneliness doesn’t make sense to me.
					The ones who are truly lonely, the word happy isn’t the word of choice. I don’t want to be just ok… I want to
					be fantastic…I’ve never heard a lonely man, who has been rejected over and over, and over, again use those
					words in any context to describe his life of loneliness and perpetual rejection. It’s not validation most guys
					that are lonely are looking for, lonely dudes are looking to fit a role of support, and when thats taken away,
					its like the feeling you have lost purpose in life. A woman or man forcing one or the other into loneliness is
					validation enough that you aren’t worth there time and effort anymore. I don’t want that type of validation
					and I’ve been suffering with this validation for 13 years now. The feeling that your life no longer has
					meaning, and you’ve been devalued.</p>

	<p>I’m ignoring every women from now on, because it seems every single one of y’all ladies doesn’t know how to treat a
		high value guy like me. Y’all treat me like I’m trash without taking the time to get to know me. You all shoot screw
		faces my direction daily like I’m a creep! <br /><br>If I try and invite you to hang out with me, y’all won’t just
		give me a no, it’s a hard maybe then you won’t show. Y’all’s smiles aren’t inviting anymore in fact the smiles are
		more like thank yous to me for not speaking to you. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Y’all won’t speak to me in an I’m interested sort of way but y’all will speak to me like I’m forever gonna be in
		the friend zone and some of y’all have sentence me to a he deserves to be alone because you are just passing time,
		and I look like an interesting person whose time you, want to waste, while waiting for your boyfriend or fiancé to
		arrive. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>If I speak to you, most of you women look at me like when is he gonna be done talking because I don’t care. It’s
		really not worth trying to strike up conversations with any women, because y’all will just wait till I start to act
		interested then spring the I have a boyfriend phrase on me as if I didn’t already assume any women without a
		boyfriend would be talking to me, then wonder why I stop speaking to you, and now don’t have time to even smile at
		you. I’m no longer interested in hearing about how great your relationship or your job is because you should be
		speaking to the shitty guy you chose over me about that stuff and not me. All y’all treat me like an atm, and when I
		no longer dispense what you need, I’m no longer in speaking terms with you. None of y’all come looking for me or
		want to make me feel special in anyway! Y’all look at your watches, and phones as soon as I start to talk, as if I’m
		boring, and you’d rather be doing something else. Y’all run off with the first guy who has inches over me knowing
		that guy doesn’t care about you, surprisingly that guy is without a car or career, but when I’m down, and out, I’m
		not an option. Y’all slander me on tik tok, or whatever stupid clout app you use. <br>Y’all would rather suffer with
		a shitty wanker than say you are sorry and work it out with me. Y’all will try to encourage me but won’t consider me
		anything other than some guy. If I am an option to y’all ladies im an option to manipulate, and then an option to
		forget about, as soon as I realize you could care less about my existence. Y’all ladies are extremely abusive
		towards me, and some of y’all have flat out punched me in the face after I was nice to you, and gave you money
		because I could, not because I actually wanted to. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>I’m the guy all you ladies pass in the hall like an outdated events poster. I’m the guy y’all ladies treat like a
		boot brush one time use and then never come back. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>I’m the guy y’all ask who hurt you, and it never actually mean you care. I’m the guy most of y’all call an incel
		but don’t consider my feelings and that we might actually hit it off, and have a loving relationship. I’m the guy
		that your girl friends tell you to stop talking to, because I don’t have this, or that and oh he’s a single dad?
		Must be his fault! that’s how all of y’all ladies for the most part treat me. I’ve never been asked anywhere by any
		women. <br>I never get compliments from any of y’all ladies, and I’m instantly rejected for complimenting you. <br>I
		would love it if just one lady approached me and asked if she could spend time with me and she actually be
		attractive and desirable without having to rush off somewhere else, but I guess I’m not good enough for that type of
		flattery. <br>it’s not even a thought going through most of y’all ladies heads. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>Y’all expect me to comply with societal standards, but I’m not allowed to hold y’all to that same standard. It’s
		not even worth looking towards most of y’all direction, because it’s assumed I’m a pervert, and I’m somehow
		offending you because I’m facing your direction. I’m the guy most of y’all ladies go out of there way to avoid, and
		make it obvious you are doing so. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>98% of y’all ladies won’t call me by my name because I’m not important enough to remember, but you will audibly
		call me a loser as soon as I turn around to walk away. I’ve never done anything to deserve mistreatment from any
		woman. Whether you ladies like men or not, I really hate the way y’all look at me, and talk about me, and reject me!
	</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>I’m such a sweet guy…. But I’m not good enough to yall ladies to maintain a relationship with on any level
		apparently. I don’t want to be friends with any woman. I want to be a lover, I want to be your man. I want to know
		you will defend me if I’m getting picked on because I’d do that for you. I want my lady to know what I like, and
		surprise me with that. I want to be catered to and not the only person doing the catering. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>I want to be thought about in such a way that I’m the guy she talks about around other guys, But until that day I
		guess I have no other choice than to be explained away as “he’s just some guy that’s in my class or “ he’s just some
		guy that’s a regular at my shop” or “he’s just some guy that I will never want or be interested in.” Y’all ladies
		subject me to punishment and force me to get used to being that guy that will never be the first choice much less
		that guy that any woman would fight to preserve a relationship with.</p>
