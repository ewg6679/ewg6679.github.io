Congratulations on your new car! Maintaining your car properly will help ensure its longevity, safety, and performance. Below is a comprehensive list of what you should do to keep your car in good shape, plus essential items you should keep in the car for emergencies or daily use.

### Regular Car Maintenance
In addition to changing the front tires and oil, here is a full list of other tasks you should consider for your car's upkeep, divided by intervals:

#### **Monthly Maintenance**
1. **Tire Pressure Check**: Use a tire pressure gauge to ensure your tires are inflated to the recommended PSI. Under-inflated tires can decrease fuel efficiency and affect handling.
2. **Fluid Levels**: Check your car’s oil, coolant, brake fluid, transmission fluid, and power steering fluid. Top up if necessary.
3. **Inspect Wipers and Windshield Fluid**: Ensure your wiper blades are in good condition and top up the windshield washer fluid.
4. **Lights Check**: Test all the lights—headlights, taillights, turn signals, brake lights, and reverse lights.
5. **Battery Terminals**: Check the battery for any corrosion or loose connections.

#### **Every 3,000–7,500 Miles**
1. **Oil Change**: Since you already mentioned an oil change, remember to also change the oil filter.
2. **Tire Rotation**: Rotate all four tires to ensure even wear.
3. **Air Filter**: Check and replace the engine air filter if necessary. A clogged air filter can reduce engine performance and fuel economy.
4. **Inspect Brake Pads**: Check the brake pads for wear and replace them if necessary. You should also inspect the brake fluid levels.
   
#### **Every 12,000–15,000 Miles**
1. **Cabin Air Filter**: Replace the cabin air filter, especially if you notice reduced airflow through the vents.
2. **Check Alignment**: Misalignment can cause uneven tire wear, poor handling, and a rough ride.
3. **Inspect Exhaust System**: Look for rust, leaks, or damages.
4. **Inspect Belts and Hoses**: Check the timing belt (if applicable) and all hoses for cracks or leaks.

#### **Every 30,000 Miles**
1. **Fuel Filter**: Replace the fuel filter to ensure proper fuel flow and maintain engine efficiency.
2. **Flush Coolant**: Flush and replace the engine coolant to prevent overheating.
3. **Inspect Suspension**: Check shocks, struts, and other suspension components for wear and tear.
4. **Change Brake Fluid**: Flush and replace the brake fluid if necessary.

#### **Every 60,000–100,000 Miles**
1. **Timing Belt**: Replace the timing belt (if your car has one) to avoid the risk of engine damage.
2. **Transmission Fluid**: Flush and replace the transmission fluid to keep the transmission working smoothly.
3. **Spark Plugs**: Replace spark plugs to maintain optimal engine performance.

#### **Every 100,000 Miles**
1. **Inspect or Replace Water Pump**: Depending on your vehicle, you may need to replace the water pump.
2. **Inspect Timing Chain**: If your car has a timing chain instead of a belt, inspect it and replace if necessary.

### Seasonal Maintenance (Summer/Winter)
- **Summer**: Check air conditioning, ensure the cooling system is in top shape, and check for any leaks in the system.
- **Winter**: Test your battery for sufficient charge (cold weather can drain it), inspect antifreeze levels, and ensure the defroster and heater are working properly.

### 2. **Schedule an Appointment and Communicate Your Needs**
Make sure you schedule an appointment in advance, especially for something like a full-service checkup, so the shop is prepared. Be clear about your needs when you book the appointment.

#### **Important Steps**:
- **Call or Book Online**: Many shops allow you to schedule appointments online, which can save time. Some also allow you to explain your needs in the booking process.
- **Explain Your Goals**: Tell them you want a **full-service checkup**, and give them a brief history of your car (150k miles, 2013 Chevy Sonic). Ask them to follow the maintenance schedule outlined by Chevrolet for your car's mileage and to inspect key components like:
  - Oil change and filter replacement
  - Brake inspection and fluid check
  - Tire check (pressure, rotation, wear)
  - Fluid levels (coolant, transmission, power steering, brake fluid)
  - Air filter and cabin filter replacement
  - Suspension and steering system inspection
  - Timing belt check (if applicable)
- **Ask for a Time Estimate**: Inquire about how long it will take to complete the service so you can plan your day accordingly.

### 3. **Get a Quote and Approval for Services**
Before any work is started, make sure to request a detailed **quote** for the services that will be performed. This ensures there are no surprises when the bill comes.

#### **Important Steps**:
- **Request a Detailed Estimate**: Ask for an itemized quote. It should include the labor, parts, and any applicable fees.
- **Ask for Alternatives**: If a service is recommended that isn’t critical (e.g., suspension checks or timing belt replacement), ask if it can be done at a later time. This will allow you to prioritize necessary services and spread out costs.
- **Get Written Approval**: Make sure to approve the quote before they begin the work. This helps avoid unexpected charges.

### 4. **Check for Specials or Discounts**
Many shops offer discounts, specials, or loyalty programs for regular customers. Check online or ask if they have any available promotions before you schedule the service. You might also find discounts on service packages, like oil changes, tire rotations, and brake inspections.

- **Look for Coupons**: Search online for coupons for oil changes or maintenance checkups at local shops (e.g., Groupon, RetailMeNot, or the shop’s website).
- **Seasonal Deals**: Sometimes, there are promotions tied to the season (e.g., winter tire checks, spring checkups) or special events at local auto repair shops.

### 5. **Drop-Off or Wait for Service**
If you need the service done quickly, you can either drop off your car or wait while it’s being worked on, depending on how much time you have. Many shops provide a comfortable waiting area with Wi-Fi or allow for drop-off and pick-up later in the day.

#### **Options**:
- **Drop-Off**: If you don’t have time to wait, arrange for a drop-off and specify a time for pick-up. Some shops offer shuttle services or rental cars if necessary.
- **Wait While It’s Done**: If you prefer to wait, ask how long the service will take and plan accordingly. For smaller services like oil changes, it could take 30 minutes to an hour.

### 6. **Review the Work Done and Final Invoice**
Once the work is complete, go over the final invoice to make sure everything that was agreed upon was done.

#### **Key Steps**:
- **Check Completed Services**: Make sure that the services on the invoice match the work you discussed. This includes oil changes, fluid checks, filter replacements, and any inspections.
- **Inspect Parts**: If they replaced any parts (e.g., filters, brake pads), ask to see the old parts as evidence that they were actually replaced.
- **Verify Costs**: Make sure the price matches the quote or that there are no unexpected charges. If the cost is higher than expected, ask for an explanation.

### 7. **Build a Relationship with the Shop**
Once you’ve found a good shop, establish a relationship with them so you can have a go-to place for future service. This can help with faster service and more personalized attention. Let them know you’ll be back for regular maintenance and ask about any membership or loyalty programs they offer.

### **Final Tips for Efficiency**:
- **Use Local Shops**: Staying local can save time and avoid long waits at bigger chains. It’s also easier to communicate with small shops.
- **Plan Ahead**: Schedule your car service during non-peak hours (e.g., weekdays, mornings) to avoid delays or long waiting times.
- **Use Your Car’s Maintenance Schedule**: Ensure that the shop follows your car manufacturer’s maintenance schedule. This can help ensure that your car is well-maintained without unnecessary services.

By following these steps, you can get your car serviced efficiently and without any hassle. If you choose the right shop, communicate clearly, and ensure that everything is properly quoted and approved, your service will go smoothly and your 2013 Chevy Sonic will stay in great condition!
