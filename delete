Congratulations on your new car! Maintaining your car properly will help ensure its longevity, safety, and performance. Below is a comprehensive list of what you should do to keep your car in good shape, plus essential items you should keep in the car for emergencies or daily use.

### Regular Car Maintenance
In addition to changing the front tires and oil, here is a full list of other tasks you should consider for your car's upkeep, divided by intervals:

#### **Monthly Maintenance**
1. **Tire Pressure Check**: Use a tire pressure gauge to ensure your tires are inflated to the recommended PSI. Under-inflated tires can decrease fuel efficiency and affect handling.
2. **Fluid Levels**: Check your car’s oil, coolant, brake fluid, transmission fluid, and power steering fluid. Top up if necessary.
3. **Inspect Wipers and Windshield Fluid**: Ensure your wiper blades are in good condition and top up the windshield washer fluid.
4. **Lights Check**: Test all the lights—headlights, taillights, turn signals, brake lights, and reverse lights.
5. **Battery Terminals**: Check the battery for any corrosion or loose connections.

#### **Every 3,000–7,500 Miles**
1. **Oil Change**: Since you already mentioned an oil change, remember to also change the oil filter.
2. **Tire Rotation**: Rotate all four tires to ensure even wear.
3. **Air Filter**: Check and replace the engine air filter if necessary. A clogged air filter can reduce engine performance and fuel economy.
4. **Inspect Brake Pads**: Check the brake pads for wear and replace them if necessary. You should also inspect the brake fluid levels.
   
#### **Every 12,000–15,000 Miles**
1. **Cabin Air Filter**: Replace the cabin air filter, especially if you notice reduced airflow through the vents.
2. **Check Alignment**: Misalignment can cause uneven tire wear, poor handling, and a rough ride.
3. **Inspect Exhaust System**: Look for rust, leaks, or damages.
4. **Inspect Belts and Hoses**: Check the timing belt (if applicable) and all hoses for cracks or leaks.

#### **Every 30,000 Miles**
1. **Fuel Filter**: Replace the fuel filter to ensure proper fuel flow and maintain engine efficiency.
2. **Flush Coolant**: Flush and replace the engine coolant to prevent overheating.
3. **Inspect Suspension**: Check shocks, struts, and other suspension components for wear and tear.
4. **Change Brake Fluid**: Flush and replace the brake fluid if necessary.

#### **Every 60,000–100,000 Miles**
1. **Timing Belt**: Replace the timing belt (if your car has one) to avoid the risk of engine damage.
2. **Transmission Fluid**: Flush and replace the transmission fluid to keep the transmission working smoothly.
3. **Spark Plugs**: Replace spark plugs to maintain optimal engine performance.

#### **Every 100,000 Miles**
1. **Inspect or Replace Water Pump**: Depending on your vehicle, you may need to replace the water pump.
2. **Inspect Timing Chain**: If your car has a timing chain instead of a belt, inspect it and replace if necessary.

### Seasonal Maintenance (Summer/Winter)
- **Summer**: Check air conditioning, ensure the cooling system is in top shape, and check for any leaks in the system.
- **Winter**: Test your battery for sufficient charge (cold weather can drain it), inspect antifreeze levels, and ensure the defroster and heater are working properly.
